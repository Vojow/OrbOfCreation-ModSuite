# Loadout and snapshot native pipeline

The pinned v1.0.5 assembly exposes two different player-facing storage systems. Player
loadouts have stable identities and switch spells plus optional Equipment and Alchemy
sections. Snapshot rows have no identity of their own; the UI addresses them by their
position in one identified Equipment or Alchemy snapshot list.

## Player loadouts

`PlayerLoadout` (`TypeDef 0x00ae`) owns `guidContainer`, `label`, `isSelected`,
`saveEquipment`, `saveAlchemy`, saved `spells`, and stacked Equipment and Alchemy records.
`Fill` creates the missing `GuidContainer`, so a filled runtime row is addressable by
`GetGuid` (`MethodDef 0x0f1e`). `PlayerLoadoutListVariable.GetAll` and
`GetActiveLoadout` are `MethodDef 0x16b1` and `0x16b0`.

`UILoadoutList.OnLoadoutClick` calls `LoadoutManager.SetLoadout` (`MethodDef 0x0610`).
The manager finds the exact target and delegates to `SetLoadoutIndex`
(`MethodDef 0x0611`), whose audited order is:

1. refuse while `CanSwapLoadouts` sees any spell casting or readying;
2. update the selected-index cache and the old/new `isSelected` flags;
3. save the old loadout;
4. deactivate the old spells;
5. load the new spells and enabled Equipment/Alchemy sections;
6. reactivate spells and recalculate spell state.

The identity-and-outcome sentinel is the requested loadout becoming selected. The native
method is used whole; reproducing its ordered save/deactivate/load/reactivate transaction is
not an approved boundary.

There is no independent Save button. `SaveActiveLoadout` (`MethodDef 0x060d`) is called by
the Equipment and Alchemy section toggles. Each toggle first calls
`PlayerLoadout.SetSaveEquipment` (`MethodDef 0x0f0f`) or `SetSaveAlchemy`
(`MethodDef 0x0f10`); enabling then calls `SaveActiveLoadout`. Disabling only clears the
section flag. The MCP surface consequently exposes section toggles, not an invented save
verb. The flag matching the requested value is the sentinel.

`UILoadoutEditor` exposes exactly three metadata controls. Text input calls
`LoadoutLabel.SetName` (`MethodDef 0x3518`) with a 24-character UI limit. The icon and color
buttons advance `(current + 1) % count` through `GlobalVariables.GetCustomSprites`
(`MethodDef 0x0571`) and `GetCustomColors` (`MethodDef 0x056f`), then call
`SetIconIndex` (`MethodDef 0x3519`) or `SetColorIndex` (`MethodDef 0x351a`). The MCP mirrors
rename, next icon, and next color; arbitrary index selection is not a UI verb. Each resulting
label value is its mutation sentinel.

Before a selected loadout is applied, every stored spell, Equipment entry, and ordinary
Alchemy entry is revalidated through the same admission helpers as its component GameAction.
The composite boundary additionally checks whole-list slot limits, Equipment type-slot limits,
per-glyph usage, and native `ResourceCostList` usage capacity. Ordinary Alchemy entries retain
their concrete action's discovery, per-recipe maximum, and usage admission; the v1.0.5 UI exposes
no independent editable type-slot layout for a stored Alchemy record. A stored reference that is
stale, hidden behind an unowned glyph, undiscovered/uncreated, over-stacked, or over capacity
refuses before `SetLoadout`.

## Snapshots

`SnapshotLoadout<T>` (`TypeDef 0x00b1`) owns only a stacked record and observer state. Its
concrete `AlchemySnapshot` (`TypeDef 0x00b2`) and `EquipmentSnapshot` (`TypeDef 0x00b3`) do
not own a UUID. The owning `AlchemySnapshotListVariable` and
`EquipmentSnapshotListVariable` are `IdScriptableObject` descendants, so the truthful stable
address is the list UUID plus the visible zero-based slot.

`UISnapshotLoadout.RenderEmpty` enables Save and disables Load/Clear. `RenderContent` enables
Load/Clear and disables Save. The supported lifecycle therefore is:

- save the current active section into an empty slot;
- load a populated slot into the active section;
- clear a populated slot.

The UI does not overwrite a populated slot. Alchemy save/load calls
`AlchemyInstanceListVariable.CreateStackedRecord` / `FromStackedRecord`
(`MethodDef 0x1615` / `0x1616`). Equipment save/load calls
`StackableListVariable<EquipmentSO>.GetStackedRecord` / `SetStack`
(`MethodDef 0x07ba` / `0x07b0`). `SnapshotLoadout<T>.SaveSnapshot`, `GetRecord`, and `Clear`
are `MethodDef 0x0f94`, `0x0f97`, and `0x0f95`.

Save is verified by the target slot becoming populated; clear by it becoming empty; load by
the active section matching the snapshot's identity/count record. Refund or resource
accounting is not part of this family.

## MCP contract

`game_loadout` accepts one of `select`, `set_section`, `rename`, `next_icon`, `next_color`,
`snapshot_save`, `snapshot_load`, or `snapshot_clear`. `uuid` names a player loadout for the
first five modes and a snapshot-list owner for snapshot modes; snapshot modes also require
`slot`. `set_section` requires `section` (`equipment` or `alchemy`) and `enabled`; rename
requires `name`.

World rows publish player loadouts and the two snapshot-list owners. Nested entries retain a
player-facing name and UUID because the caller can act on them through their component tools.
Mutation responses contain only the settled changed fact and the next immediately relevant
state.
