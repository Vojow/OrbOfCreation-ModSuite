# Native action surfaces

[Back to index](README.md)

Each decompiled action path is given as the call sequence, the admission short-circuit in its real
order, the stable identities involved, and the constraints that make a naive call fail. Metadata
tokens are from the audited build ([audited-build.md](audited-build.md)) and die with a game update;
they identify a member, they do not replace resolving it.

The costs these paths charge are in [resources-and-bigdouble.md](resources-and-bigdouble.md).

## Two routers sit above several families

`UICostButton.OnClick` (`0x06002204`) is the paid-action router. It checks
`ResourceCostList.HasEnough()` (`0x06001E0F`), invokes `PerformCost()` (`0x06001E19`), and only then
invokes its configured callback. Every family reached through a cost button therefore pays **before**
the domain call, and the domain method itself neither prices nor charges. Re-driving such a path at
the data layer means reproducing that order on purpose: read and decide, then `PerformCost`, then the
domain method. The order is not universal — read the terminal method before assuming payment came
first, because at least one family commits before it pays.

`UILevelableItem.PurchaseLevel` (`0x06002467`) routes to `ILevelable.PurchaseLevel`, and
`PurchaseFreeLevel` (`0x06002468`) routes to `ILevelableHasFree.PurchaseFreeLevel`. One control
therefore levels several unrelated native types. Audited implementers are a partial list —
`GlyphSO`, `EquipmentTypeSO` (`0x06000B66`), `ResourceTypeSO`, `TimeRuneSO` (`0x06001847`) — so
enumerate the interface's implementations in the assembly rather than assuming this set.

## Purchasing structures and upgrades

### Surface

| Concern | Structure | Upgrade |
|---|---|---|
| Registry | `StructureSO.All` | `UpgradeSO.All` |
| UI entry | `UIStructureList.PurchaseStructure` (`0x06002763`) | `UIUpgradeButton.ClickUpgradeButton` (`0x06002944`) |
| Availability | `IsAvailable()` | `IsAvailable()` |
| Admission | `CanPurchase()` | `CanPurchase()` |
| Cost | `GetPurchaseCost()` → `ResourceCostList` | `GetPurchaseCost()` → `ResourceCostList` |
| Current level | `GetPurchaseLevel()` | `GetPurchaseLevel()` |
| Queued state | `GetQueuedQuantity()` | `GetQueuedPurchaseLevel()` |
| Mutation | `Purchase(bool)` (`0x06001784`) | `Purchase()` (`0x060018A6`) |
| Queue signal | `QueueBuild(int)` | `Purchase()` |
| Completion | `CompleteAction()` | `CompleteAction()` |
| Finite lifecycle | — | `HasFiniteLevels()`, `IsMaxLevel()`, `IsMaxQueuedLevel()` |

`QueueBuild(int)`, `Purchase()`, and `CompleteAction()` are the three viable Harmony targets on
this path: the first two are where queue state is mutated, the third is where it settles.

### `CanPurchase()` does less than its name suggests

This is the most misread member on the surface. It folds in **live requirements and queue
admission** — and neither availability nor cost.

```text
Structure:
    IsAvailable()  = prerequisites.Check()
    CanPurchase()  = prerequisitesPerLevel.Check(ConditionInfo(quantity))
                     && queue.HasRoom()

Upgrade:
    CanPurchase()  = !IsMaxQueuedLevel()
                     && purchaseCost.HasEnough()
                     && !IsMaxLevel()
                     && prerequisites.Check()
                     && prerequisitesPerLevel.Check(ConditionInfo(level + queuedLevels + 1))
                     && queue.HasRoom()
```

The orders matter because they short-circuit: an Upgrade that is at its queued maximum never
evaluates cost, and a Structure never evaluates cost at all. Availability and affordability are
your job on the Structure path.

Note that both `prerequisitesPerLevel` checks take the level as an argument — the level a purchase
would *reach*, which is `quantity` for a structure and `level + queuedLevels + 1` for an upgrade.
That is the one admission term that cannot be answered from a snapshot taken earlier.

A player never meets any of this, because the buy button runs its own preflight — per-level
prerequisite, affordability, queue room — and renders the cost line red instead of firing. Red is
the interface's check, not the data layer's. Driving the data layer directly, an attribute purchase
that cannot be paid for silently does nothing: admission passes (cost is untested there), and the
purchase's own per-level payment commits zero levels — no error, no queue entry, no message.

### Diagnosing a refusal

When `CanPurchase()` says no, decompose it by asking the game the readable terms separately:
`IsAvailable()`, `IsMaxLevel()`, `IsMaxQueuedLevel()`, and `GetPurchaseCost().HasEnough()` — the
game's own verdict on the price, not a re-pricing.

If only `HasEnough()` refuses, quantities moved after you read them; that is ordinary staleness.
If availability or a level cap refuses, your model of the entity is wrong. **If every readable
term passes, the parameterized per-level prerequisite is the refusing term by elimination.** You can
also ask that term directly: its one-parameter `Check(ConditionInfo)` overload is safe to call from
a read pass, unlike the parameterless `Check()` — see [requirements.md](requirements.md).

### The owning-view reachability chain

Player-facing reachability is a property of the owning `ViewSO`, not of the item: a natively
purchasable entity can sit inside a tab whose view is unavailable, and item-only reads cannot see
that gate. The authored ownership edge is indirect:

```text
candidate exact UUID + exact native type
  → exact StructureListVariable / UpgradeListVariable membership
  → ViewSO.relevantLists or ViewSO.availableLists
  → exact owning ViewSO
  → ViewSO.IsAvailable()   (driven by ViewSO.prerequisites)
```

For a structure, the resolver additionally proves `StructureSO.structureType` is an exact
`StructureTypeSO` containing that exact structure reference exactly once in its private
`structures` list. Both view list fields participate; the same view/list route appearing in both
collapses to one; different matching routes are ambiguous. A missing, unreadable, ambiguous, or
contradictory route is a named status, not an empty gap. The proving incident: `ConstructionAura`
(`6a361a01-8405-4fbc-9af1-42f471911d9e`) present and purchasable in the `ArtificerStructures` list
(`2c3b16bc-1eb4-4382-9d93-0d20f81f07a9`) while its owning `WorkshopArtificer` view
(`b8ebce37-ba04-42bc-b36d-63f7a7766a21`) was unavailable — the item itself carried no tab
prerequisite.

The authored route shapes: most content carries two. Either a parent tab and its subtab show the
same list (the *Witchcraft* attribute sits in a single Wizardry list shown by both Magic and
Wizardry), or a candidate sits in an aggregate list and a screen list at once (a Wizardry upgrade
in both the all-upgrades aggregate and Magic's own upgrade list — aggregates are legitimate routes,
not summaries). The persistent right-panel Upgrades / Inventory strip is genuinely global and
always available, a route in its own right. Single-route content is where things go missing:
*Life Weaver* is reachable only through World > Druidry, because World does not co-reference its
subtabs the way Magic co-references Wizardry.

### Making the mutation

`StructureSO.Purchase(true)` forces exactly **one** level and consults no multiplier;
`UpgradeSO.Purchase()` honours the global multi-buy. The same intent therefore produces two
shapes: a bulk structure buy is **N calls**, re-checking `CanPurchase()` before each level past
the first; a bulk upgrade buy is **one call** with `GlobalVariables.GetMultiBuy()` set to N and
restored afterwards (protocol in [modding-hooks.md](modding-hooks.md)). Both accept a queued delta
in `[1, N]` — either can commit fewer levels than asked for, any committed level is a success, and
only a zero delta is a miss.

### Disabling a structure

`UIStructureList.ToggleDisableStructure` (`0x06002765`) calls `StructureSO.ToggleDisabled`, and each
half is ordered: `DisableStructure` sets the disabled flag and then calls `RemoveEffects`, while
`EnableStructure` clears the flag and then calls `ApplyEffects`. Flag and effects are separate
observations, so one having moved without the other is a real failure mode rather than display lag.

### Where an upgrade's reward lands

An `UpgradeSO` can carry authored `viewListAdditions`: `ViewListVariable.ListTuple` values whose
inherited `list` and `element` fields `UpgradeSO.ApplyListAdditions()` applies. Neither
`CanPurchase()` nor `Purchase()` inspects that destination, so a full one is admitted and charged
like any other purchase.

Traverse every tuple before paying. A tuple targeting an unbounded list needs no gate; a
capacity-bound one must match an audited exact list/max identity pair and answer live
`HasEmptySpot()`. The audited pair is the world-aspect destination `CreatedWorldAspects`
(`74ec1f90-e94c-4cd7-a1d0-7b35016b57ff`), whose `AbstractListVariable<ViewSO>.maxSizeVariable` is
the `WorldAspectSlots` `IntVariable` (`4b1bb2de-723a-4360-827c-8e4483f3ff8d`). An unknown pair, a
malformed tuple, an identity contradiction, or a full destination refuses before payment. The rule
has an origin: an aspect bought against zero free pedestals without this gate made the game
manifest an extra slot, and a later slot grant left one permanently empty.

### Queue and completion

Queue authority is `ActionManager.GetRemainingRoom()` together with
`ActionManager.instance.actionableItems.maxQueuedItems.AsInt()`. Read them as a pair immediately
before acting; capacity grows through ordinary progression without any lifecycle boundary firing,
and `Player.GetBulkDevelopment()` is a separate value that only shapes grouping.

Payment lands at queue time, not completion: the game prices the levels it is queueing at that
moment and charges as it queues, so queueing a large group spends its whole sum at once.

**The upgrade path never checks room per level.** One committed level is one queue slot —
`UpgradeSO.Purchase()` loops the multi-buy multiplier and `QueueAction` stacks once per committed
level — and that loop consults `GetRemainingRoom()` nowhere; its only per-level term is a
`HasEnough()` that breaks the loop once the next level is unaffordable. A caller holding slots back
must clamp its own request to `remainingRoom - reservedSlots`: with room 5, a reserve of 3 and a
request of 4, the admission check passes, four levels queue, and one slot is left. The structure
path is one slot per call, because `Purchase(true)` queues exactly one level.

A completion can unlock unrelated content — including content in the *other* registry. So
`CompleteAction()` returning invalidates more than the entity that completed, and a completion
postfix should trigger a broader re-read rather than a targeted one.

### Prerequisite breadth

Before traversing a prerequisite graph, know how wide it is. `Prerequisites.Container` holds
nested AND/OR graphs over conditions on Upgrades, Structures, Research, Resources, Numbers, Lists,
Views, Spells, Alchemy, Rituals, Equipment, prerequisite links, and generic upgradeable values.
Measure the subtypes actually attached to your candidates from the serialized assets; IL proves
only which are possible.

## Consumables

### Surface

Five verbs share the inventory list. Each one's UI route ends in a `ConsumableSO` member:

| Verb | UI route | Terminal member |
|---|---|---|
| Use | `UIConsumableRefList.ClickConsumable` (`0x0600229B`) | `SelectAndFire()` |
| Cancel one pending use | `UIConsumableRefList.CancelConsumable` (`0x0600229D`) | `CancelUsage` (`0x060009D2`) |
| Discard stock | `UIConsumableRefList.DiscardConsumable` (`0x0600229E`) | `Discard` (`0x060009D3`) |
| Randomize on/off | `UIConsumableRefItem.TurnRandomizationOn/Off` (`0x06002296`/`0x06002297`) | `SetRandomization` (`0x060009D1`) |
| Reorder | `UIConsumableRefList.OnDrop` (`0x0600229A`) | list `SwapPositions` → `UpdateObservable` |

Discard reads `GlobalVariables.GetMultiBuy()` for its amount and the native call clamps to
`min(requested, live amount)` — asking for more than you hold is not a refusal.

`CancelUsage` is identity work, not counter work: it obtains `ConsumableUsage.GetResultInfo`
(`0x06000DD1`), calls `EffectResultInfo.Cancel` (`0x06001BFC`), removes that usage, then calls
`PrepNextUsage`. The thing cancelled is one exact `ConsumableUsage`, so a queue count that fell by
one proves nothing about *which* pending use ended.

Reorder is same-list only. `OnDrop` guards on same-list and differing indices, swaps within the
authored `ConsumableRefListVariable`, and the hotbar then applies `SetAt`. Moving an item between
the inventory and the hotbar is not a native verb; there is no member to drive for it.

### Family is a set, not a subtype

There is no per-family class. Family is membership in `ConsumableSO.consumableTypes`, a set of
`ConsumableTypeSO` references:

| Family | UUID | Native name |
|---|---|---|
| Fruit | `46e0ab83-df7c-4f35-8012-3d9a3c97b753` | `Fruit` |
| Potion | `8103dae4-6945-4d18-b562-d2ffcd7ef49e` | `Potion` |
| Relic | `5d27b76e-eed3-49cc-a069-b9106000ede4` | `Relic` |
| Scroll | `70b36536-64e5-4f70-ad6f-af5787d719cc` | `ScrollConsumable` |
| Thread | `66a50127-5210-4a3a-93f4-952287858b90` | `ThreadConsumable` |

The set is not a discriminator, but an item's *operation* is single. The asset census finds 68
authored consumables across exactly eight membership patterns. In every multi-membership pattern
the second family records an acquisition channel or category — Fruit, Treasure, Modification,
Resource, Food — rather than a second operation, so a treasure relic and a fruit relic are both
just Relics. The only two-operation topology authored is the four permanent fruits (Blitz Berry,
Continuous Coconut, Frugal Fig, Power Pear) carried as both `Fruit` and `Relic`; they behave as
Relics. Encode that as the exact authored set — do not invent a general precedence rule for
combinations the game does not contain.

### Call sequence

```text
ConsumableSO.SelectAndFire()
  → CollectQuantity(GlobalVariables.GetMultiBuy())
    → CanFire()
    → consumeCost.PerformCost()
  → queuedQuantity++
  → Inventory.QueueConsumable(this)
  → an idle inventory begins preparing the queued item
```

Payment happens inside `CollectQuantity`, before the queue increment — so the observable edge of a
successful submission is stock −1 and queued quantity +1. Everything after that (preparation,
random target selection, the actual effect) is game-owned and is not evidence that the effect
landed.

`Inventory.CanUseConsumable()` is a **global** single-preparation gate: one item prepares at a
time, across every family, so any pending preparation refuses every other submission.

### Scrolls target structures

A Scroll needs `canBeRandomized`, then `SetRandomization(true)` confirmed by `IsRandomized()`. Its
authored graph contains exactly one `RequestTargetEffectScript`; that script's
`TargetSelectOptions.GetTargeting()` resolves to `Targeting.TargetStructure`, and
`TargetStructure.GetRandomList(ScalingInfo.Basic(level))` computes candidates against the
strongest owned level — filtering visible eligible structures, applying the serialized enchantment
matcher, and ordering deficient targets. **An empty list is a normal outcome**, meaning the Scroll
would not upgrade anything; it is not an error and not a reason to enter the manual targeting
branch.

### `Gain()` admission runs after payment

`ConsumableSO.Gain()` first clamps its positive incoming amount to `maximumCarryLoad` — a
non-positive carry limit therefore guarantees the entire gain is lost. At capacity, "weakest" is
defined by level only: an incoming level strictly above the weakest owned unit replaces it; an
equal level replaces a unit without changing level coverage; a strictly weaker level is
decremented to zero and silently dropped. Native `UICraftingPage.QueueCraft` pays
`CraftingRecipeSO.PurchaseQuantity` before construction, and instant and queued completion run the
identical `ConsumableGainEffect → ConsumableSO.Gain()` path — so the capacity decision always
happens after payment.

### Levelled stock

`ConsumableSO.consumableCounts` is a list of `ConsumableCount` rows, each with `GetLevel()` and
`GetQuantity()`. Aggregate quantity is the wrong question: use selects the **strongest** count and
carries that count's scaling through the effect. Read `GetStrongestLevel()`, `GetStrongest()`, and
`GetCountScalingInfo()` instead of summing.

---

## Harvest availability

Plot and action availability on the Agromancy screen is cached behind the interface: the plot
list's own render pass is what re-evaluates it, and a passed check latches on rather than being
re-tested. Growth and timers advance with the screen closed; only the availability evaluation is
screen-bound. An actually-available action can therefore read unavailable until the screen has
been opened once — the reason a published prerequisite latch is evidence only, and the exact
current action still gets one live validation at the action boundary.

---

## Crafting and scribing

### Identities

The recipe type is `ScribeCrafting`, `ee001474-8209-4238-9566-84899a877226`, a
`CraftingRecipeTypeSO`. The registry is `ScribeCraftingRecipes`,
`2917516f-34a5-47b7-85b2-0b2f9ab3a29f`, a `CraftingRecipeListVariable`, holding exactly six
serialized recipes: `CraftScrollAdvancement`, `CraftScrollDevelopment`, `CraftScrollEcho`,
`CraftScrollExcellence`, `CraftScrollLearning`, `CraftScrollPower`.

Each role is a recipe / Scroll / enchantment triple:

| Role | Recipe | Scroll | Enchantment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Advancement | `a4a02a8f-6573-411c-a30c-6d9bcee12605` | `5f6aa08d-7da6-4c7a-89c9-aabcfe48e886` | `0796ee25-e1f6-4c5c-abba-aad46e02318b` |
| Power | `9c0a2b96-45fa-4aca-83ba-8efad8895608` | `4bb8af50-fc7d-44a7-b1fc-937c390f8aec` | `b9d5f0f7-43fd-4bad-a8e2-8a73f2f1d1d6` |
| Learning | `49da8d21-0f6a-492e-bd9a-15531b1737d5` | `ec14ee5d-66a3-4b28-a271-25dca2414387` | `b74c2058-4113-4b6c-b11e-1c97304d236c` |
| Excellence | `6c5c36ea-4736-46d2-b961-6227d4cce5d3` | `49057abe-fe54-481e-99bc-2b82c3995c6b` | `7b17670e-b3b6-401f-83f7-9c0e6d157852` |
| Development | `b15690ab-828c-42b9-ad69-70f169a45961` | `09d6101a-460d-4ce9-b7d4-46c4abaeadb7` | `cb354ece-fd8c-4ffc-a67e-b24cc3fe5fa5` |
| Echo | `008ccaa9-da26-4b55-95a5-5bc5df9c62f0` | `164dbfa9-8b9f-4976-9d17-ad3ad6b07a62` | `d854b177-865f-45ee-97a3-23d904df1ba1` |
| Investment | no audited recipe | `da5eab6d-ab4c-4b32-aca1-2e83b6d3a64b` | `f75cea6e-5d21-439f-bce4-79199b22434d` |
| Speed | no audited recipe | `b2232a7d-5c97-44c9-9520-686e99fa8293` | `9f068bad-f3a0-47de-84f4-407e67622fe1` |

Investment and Speed are real Scroll and enchantment identities with no recipe in the registry —
the code-side half of the open question in
[`game-systems/open-questions.md`](../game-systems/open-questions.md). Do not
infer a production path for them from the existence of the identities.

A triple is proved by edges, never by names: exactly six exact `CraftingRecipeSO` values in the
registry, exactly one `ScribeCrafting` type reference on the recipe, `useQuantityAsLevel = true`
alongside `CraftingRecipeTypeSO.isLevelType = true`, exactly one `ConsumableGainEffect` output
naming that role's Scroll, exactly one `RequestTargetEffectScript` on the Scroll behind an exact
`TargetStructure` selector, and exactly one `EnchantItemScript` naming the role's enchantment. A
missing, extra, wrong-typed or contradictory edge leaves the relationship unknown; it never
degrades to a name-based mapping.

### Two routes, chosen by whether a page owns the recipe

`UICraftingRecipeList.ClickCraft` (`0x060022E1`) invokes the installed page callback when there is
one and otherwise calls `CraftingRecipeSO.Execute` (`0x06000A32`). Which route a recipe takes is a
property of the authored page relations, not a caller decision.

`Execute` is the synchronous direct composite — the one place crafting has a non-UI entry point:

```text
CraftingRecipeSO.Execute()
  → CanBuy()                          0x06000A2A
  → GetPurchaseQuantity()             0x06000A30
  → recipeCost                        0x040005F1
  → ResourceCostList.Multiply()       0x06001E3B
  → ResourceCostList.PerformCost()    0x06001E19
  → PassiveObservable.Channel.Update()
```

`GetEffectChannel().Observe("craft").GetObservableId()` is the direct route's directional outcome
sentinel: the audited composite increments it only after cost admission, so a strictly larger id
proves the synchronous native action completed without reconstructing a resource ledger.

The page route has no equivalent. `UICraftingPage.UIStart` installs `ContextRecipeClick` and
`ContextRecipeInteraction` and owns the authored recipe-list, queue, mode and main-type relations;
`ContextRecipeClick` reads the recipe's current queue quantity, obtains
`GetPurchaseQuantity(previous)`, then calls `UICraftingPage.QueueCraft` (`0x060022F0`), whose
sequence and consequences are in [ui-internals.md](ui-internals.md). Automating a timed recipe means
re-driving that sequence below the handler.

Three constraints follow, and each breaks a naive call:

- **The page relation is the queue.** A timed recipe with no authored page has no queue to join, and
  a recipe reachable from two loaded pages is ambiguous rather than a free choice. Prove that exactly
  one page holds the same recipe object before choosing a route.
- **Stack versus new instance is a native read.** `QueueCraft` reads the native craft mode and either
  calls `CraftingInstance.AddQuantity` (`0x06000DE2`) on the exact existing instance for that recipe
  or constructs a new one; the caller does not pick.
- **Queue room is branch-dependent.** `HasSpaceForCraft` permits a full queue in stack mode when the
  exact recipe already has an instance, and requires native list room otherwise. A blanket capacity
  check refuses work the game accepts.

Cost lineage differs by route too: the direct route prices `recipeCost.Multiply(purchaseAmount)`,
the page route `GetTotalCost(previousQuantity, purchaseAmount)`. Quoting one route's price for the
other misprices the craft.

### Level authority

`CraftingRecipeTypeSO` saves two distinct values: `startingLevel`, the manual-crafting selector,
and `maxStartingLevel`, the highest unlocked starting level.
`CraftingRecipeSO.GetStartingQuantity()` reads the **former**, while a `CraftingInstance` carries
its own `quantity`. Supply the level to the instance; do not write `startingLevel`.

Payment and progression are one composite:

```text
CraftingRecipeSO.PurchaseQuantity(purchasedQuantity, previousQuantity)
  → pay GetTotalCost(previousQuantity, purchasedQuantity)
  → CraftingRecipeTypeSO.SetMaxStartingLevel(purchasedQuantity + previousQuantity)
```

`SetMaxStartingLevel` keeps the **larger** of the old and proposed values, so for a one-shot
purchase with `previousQuantity = 0` the transition is `max(before, purchasedLevel)`. That ceiling
is shared across recipes; a cheap recipe raising it does not advance any other Scroll, whose own
frontier is its `maxCreatedLv`.

`CraftingRecipeSO.CanBuyAt(BigDouble)` is **monotonic in level** — bracket the first unaffordable
level and binary-search it rather than probing linearly.

### Instances and enchantments

Two `CraftingInstanceListVariable`s hold the live work: `ActiveScribeInstances`
(`b557060a-e109-40de-9a7d-f2b02bc9766d`) and `AutoScribeInstances`
(`f6cb65a8-a959-477c-9293-ff66f646c95d`). The game's own automation creates or updates one
repeating instance per recipe in the second; neither list retains caller ownership, so those
instances are observable but not editable by anyone else.

Queue ownership and `CraftingInstance.IsAuto()` normally agree, but the game does not make that
an invariant at insertion. `CraftingInstanceListVariable.Initialize()` normalizes existing items
with `SetAuto(isAutoList)`, `UICraftingPage.QueueCraft()` creates a non-auto instance, and
`CraftingInstanceListVariable.AutomateCraft()` calls `SetAuto()` before adding an automatic one.
However, inherited `GenericListVariable<CraftingInstance>.Add()` does not set the flag and the
public `CraftingInstance.SetAuto(bool)` remains mutable after insertion. World capture therefore
verifies both facts and fails loudly if an instance contradicts its containing queue.

This mechanism was audited from Orb of Creation v1.0.5 `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, SHA-256
`46b723ad8e3df5adf7186ec32b220c338e26c1cc79369e01213c091155073bdc`, decompiled with
ILSpy 10.1.1.8388.

New queued work is proved by reference membership of the exact newly constructed instance, not by
finding any instance with the same recipe and quantity. Instant work has no queue destination;
`CraftingInstance.InstantCraft()` reaches `CompleteCraft`, whose monotonic sentinel for a one-shot
instance is `IsExpired()` changing to true.

Every `StructureSO` owns an `EnchantmentSO.EnchantTable`. A native enchantment upgrade keeps a
stronger existing instance and replaces an equal-or-lower one only when the proposed scaling is
**strictly** stronger under `CanUpgradeEnchantment`. An apply that appears to do nothing usually
proposed equal scaling.

## Research development

### Surface

| Concern | Member |
|---|---|
| Identity | `ResearchSO` |
| Develop | `UIResearchItem.DevelopResearch` (`0x060025F0`) → `ResearchSO.PurchaseLevel` (`0x060011B4`) |
| Route switch | `SettingsManager.IsResearchQueueMode` → `Develop` (`0x060011B5`) or `QueueDevelopment` (`0x060011B6`) |
| Pause / resume | `UIResearchItem.PauseResearch` / `ResumeResearch` (`0x060025F1`/`0x060025F2`) → the same-named `ResearchSO` members |
| Cancel | `UIResearchItem.CancelDevelopment` (`0x060025F7`) → `ResearchSO.CancelDevelopment` (`0x060011B7`) |
| Free bonus level | `UIResearchItem.AddBonusLevel` (`0x060025F8`) → `CanApplyBonusLevels` → `SubmitBonusLevel` (`0x060011BA`) |

`PurchaseLevel` is a dispatcher, not a verb: one setting decides whether the same click develops now
or queues.

### The queued route accepts a prefix, and its cost probe lies

```text
QueueDevelopment()
  → read native multi-buy
  → clamp against the authored maximum
  → per candidate level:
      GetDevelopmentCostAtLevel(level)
      ResourceCostList.Add(cumulative)
      cumulative HasEnough()
      IsWithinDevelopRangeAt(level)
  → ApplyResearchCost for the accepted levels only
  → an idle target immediately starts the first accepted level
```

Affordability is cumulative across the batch, so the accepted set is a prefix ending at the first
level that fails `HasEnough` or `IsWithinDevelopRangeAt`. **`ResourceCostList.Add` mutates the
cumulative list before the failing candidate is rejected**, so the object left behind after the loop
includes a level the game refused. Quoting it overstates the price; rebuild the accepted prefix in a
second pass through the same native cost members instead of returning the last probe.

Waiting levels live inside the research node. They are not entries in the global action queue, and
queue room is not a term in this admission.

### The other four verbs

The immediate route sets developing and active state, applies the research cost, recalculates derived
research data, and establishes its drain. Pause and resume change the active-drain state only, and
the interface exposes them **only with Research Queue Mode disabled**. Cancel clears active,
developing and waiting state, reapplies the cost calculation, recalculates, and calls
`ResourceFillList.ClearInvestment`. Bonus submission applies one self-bonus level and updates its
research-type usage; the compiler-generated predicate behind `CanApplyBonusLevels` asks each
associated `ResearchTypeSO.HasFreeBonusLevelsLeft`.

Which level a research node reports depends on the accessor called, and the prerequisite, completion
and cap paths do not agree — see [requirements.md](requirements.md).

## Discovering a discoverable

`IDiscoverable` has exactly six implementers in this build:

| Type | `Discover` |
|---|---|
| `AlchemyRecipeSO` | `0x06000850` |
| `EquipmentSO` | `0x06000B10` |
| `GlyphSO` | `0x06000BFB` |
| `RitualSO` | `0x06001366` |
| `SpellRecipeSO` | `0x06001432` |
| `TimeRuneSO` | `0x06001858` |

The interface owns the whole read side of the decision: `Discover` (`0x06001C97`),
`GetDiscoverCost` (`0x06001C92`), `IsDiscoverVisible` (`0x06001C93`), `CanDiscover` (`0x06001C94`),
`IsDiscovered` (`0x06001C95`) and `IsDiscoverRequired` (`0x06001C96`).

`UIDiscoverablePage.HandleClick` (`0x0600231C`) hands the selected object to a `UICostButton` whose
terminal callback is that object's own `Discover`, so payment precedes discovery on this path.

Two implementers are not plain. `EquipmentSO.Discover` immediately calls `EquipmentSO.Create`
(`0x06000B11`) and equips nothing. `SpellRecipeSO` is driven through the spell manager's state
machine below, whose payment ordering is the reverse of this one.

## Discovery tree offers

### Surface

| Concern | Member |
|---|---|
| Registry | `DiscoveryTreeSO.All` |
| Visibility | `IsVisible()` (`0x06000AD5`) |
| Mode gates | `IsInIdleMode()`, `IsInCraftingMode()`, `IsInChoiceMode()` |
| Anything to offer | `HasCurrentlyRemMainPoolDiscoveries()`, `HasImmediateRequiredDiscover()` (`0x06000AC6`) |
| Start | `InitiateCraftingMode()` (`0x06000AA8`) |
| Select | `SelectItemId(Guid)` (`0x06000AAB`) |
| Confirm | `DiscoverSelectedItem()` (`0x06000AAC`) → `DiscoverItem(IDiscoverable)` (`0x06000AAD`) |
| Reroll | `RerollChoices()` (`0x06000AB1`), capped by `GetMaxRerolls()` (`0x06000ACB`) |
| Next price | `GetNextItemCost()` (`0x06000AB8`) |
| Offer resolution | `GetItemFromGuid(Guid)` (`0x06000ABF`) |
| State | `actionMode` (`0x04000643`), `actionTime` (`0x04000644`), `rerollsLeft` (`0x04000645`), `usedRerollsLastDiscover` (`0x04000646`), `currentChoiceIds` (`0x04000647`), `nextExcludedIds`, `selectedChoiceId` |

Offer UUIDs arrive wrapped: `currentChoiceIds` holds `GuidContainer` values read through
`get_guid()` (`0x06001B44`). The UI edges are `UIDiscoveryTreePage.OnDiscoveryClick`
(`0x0600232B`), `OnDiscoveryItemClick` (`0x0600232C`), `OnConfirmClick` (`0x0600232D`) and
`OnRerollClick` (`0x0600232E`).

### Initiating is synchronous; the offers are not

`InitiateCraftingMode` refreshes the earned reroll under a `Math.Min` against `GetMaxRerolls`,
clears `usedRerollsLastDiscover`, calls `FetchRarityLevels` (`0x06000AB3`), then `EnterCraftingMode`
(`0x06000AA9`) → `EnterMode` (`0x06000AA7`), which writes `actionMode` and `actionTime` and calls
`PassiveObservable.UpdateObservable` (`0x06001DD9`). That observable only increments an observed id
and invokes no UI code, so Idle → Crafting has no render dependency whatsoever: **a returning
initiate that leaves the tree Idle is a contract divergence, not a missing screen.**

Offers materialize later inside the game's own increment loop, where `IncrementCrafting`
(`0x06000AA0`) calls `EnterChoiceMode` (`0x06000AAA`) to create `currentChoiceIds` — and resets to
Idle if no choice can be made. Crafting is the outcome of initiating; a populated offer list is not.

`InitiateCraftingMode` does not pay. The cost button does, so a data-layer re-drive invokes
`PerformCost` itself, first.

### Selection and confirmation

`SelectItemId` assigns `selectedChoiceId` and nothing else. **Membership in `currentChoiceIds` is
the eligibility gate, not `CanDiscover`**: `CollectDiscoveryChoices` deliberately offers future
choices whose ordinary prerequisite verdict is false, so gating a selection on `CanDiscover` refuses
offers the game means you to be able to take.

`DiscoverItem` increments counts, removes rarity, resets mode, offers and selection, and calls the
target's `Discover` **last**. An exception part-way therefore leaves a real partial commit — counters
moved and tree reset, target not discovered — and the tree's own state cannot tell you which side of
that line you are on. Read the target's `IsDiscovered`.

### Reroll leaves the old selection behind

`RerollChoices` copies the current offers into `nextExcludedIds`, clears the offers, debits a reroll,
sets the used-reroll flag, and re-enters Crafting. It does **not** clear `selectedChoiceId`, so a
stale selection survives until new offers appear; drive `SelectItemId(Guid.Empty)` yourself if that
matters. Reroll is not offered on the immediate-required path.

### The ledger cannot verify this path

An audited initiate charged `4.4e3` and `8.9e6` against holdings of `2.1e19` and `5.7e23`.
`BigDouble` could represent neither subtraction, so both holdings stayed byte-for-byte unchanged
while the same call moved the tree from Idle to Crafting and offers duly appeared. A resource delta
is evidence about the ledger, never proof about the action — see
[resources-and-bigdouble.md](resources-and-bigdouble.md).

## Spell discovery and creation

### Surface

| Concern | Member |
|---|---|
| Manager | `SpellManager.instance` (`0x040004AD`) |
| Selection lists | `selectedCoreGlyphs` (`0x04000499`), `selectedAugmentGlyphs` (`0x0400049A`) |
| Loadout | `activeSpells` (`0x0400049C`), `AddSpell` (`0x0600074B`) |
| Recipe registry | `SpellRecipeSO.All` (`0x04000A32`) |
| Authored cores | `SpellRecipeSO.GetGlyphRecipe()` (`0x06001447`) |
| Selection resolution | `SpellManager.GetSpellFromRecipe(List<GlyphSO>)` (`0x06000747`) |
| Discover | `SpellManager.DiscoverSpell()` (`0x06000741`) → `SpellRecipeSO.Discover()` (`0x06001432`) |
| Create | `SpellManager.CreateSpell()` (`0x0600073F`) → `CreateRecipe` → `SpellRecipeSO.CreateWith(...)` |
| Costs | Discovery: `SpellRecipeSO.GetDiscoverCost()` (`0x06001442`); screen-priced creation: `SpellManager.GetSpellCreateCost(List<GlyphSO>)` (`0x0600074A`); lower-level modifier fold: `GlyphSO.GetCreationCostOfList(ResourceCostList, IEnumerable<GlyphSO>)` |
| Verdicts | `SpellRecipeSO.CanDiscover()` (`0x06001451`), `IsCreatable()` (`0x0600144F`) |
| Room | `EmptyTypeListVariable<T>.HasEmptySpot()` (`0x0600155C`), `GenericListVariable<T>.Empty()` (`0x06001569`) |
| Instance identity | `Spell.guidContainer` (`0x040007DF`) |

### Selection has no method

No native member represents the selection gesture. The UI drives list operations, and so must
anything else:

```text
resolve exactly one SpellRecipeSO from SpellRecipeSO.All
read its ordered GetGlyphRecipe() core sequence
require every entry to be an exact, available, non-augment GlyphSO
empty selectedCoreGlyphs and selectedAugmentGlyphs
append the authored core sequence in order
GetSpellFromRecipe() must resolve to the requested recipe, with zero selected augments
```

`GetSpellFromRecipe` is the only proof that a selection means what you think it means; a list of the
right length is not.

### Discovery commits before it pays

```text
SpellManager.DiscoverSpell()
  → GetSpellFromRecipe(selectedCoreGlyphs)
  → SpellRecipeSO.Discover()
  → ResourceCostList.PerformCost()
```

This is the audited counterexample to the cost-button order: the game itself can leave a recipe
discovered and unpaid. Preflight everything you can before entering it, do not reorder it, and do
not read a missing charge as a failed discovery.

`PostDiscoverRecipe` may auto-equip an instance, so a discovery can change the loadout without being
asked to.

### Creation is instance work

`CreateSpell()` resolves the current core selection and delegates to `CreateRecipe`, which consumes
the selected augments, calls `SpellRecipeSO.CreateWith(...)`, adds the result through `AddSpell`, and
then clears the selection. The interface's own gate is `GetSpellCreateCost(...).HasEnough()` beside a
discovered, `IsCreatable()` recipe and `activeSpells.HasEmptySpot()`.

**StaticallyVerified (macOS v1.0.5-2 baseline):** `UICreateSpellButton.Render` concatenates the
selected core and augment lists, resolves that full list with `GetSpellFromRecipe`, and passes the
same list to `SpellManager.GetSpellCreateCost`. The manager returns an empty cost when resolution
fails; otherwise it filters that list with `GlyphSO.IsSpellAugment` and folds only those augment
glyphs through `GlyphSO.GetCreationCostOfList`, starting from a new empty `ResourceCostList`. The
lower-level static combiner is therefore an implementation step, not an equivalent screen-pricing
entry point for an unfiltered core-plus-augment list. The GameAction uses the manager lineage so its
admission and payment match the price rendered by the button.

The result is a runtime `Spell` carrying its own non-empty `guidContainer` UUID. **Recipe UUID and
name are not instance identity**: two instances of one recipe are separate targets for every later
verb, and a loadout count that grew does not name what was created.

---

## Spell output level and augment composition

### Output is one global dial

`Spell.GetOutputLevel()` reads `Player.GetSpellOutputLevel()` (`0x06000690`), and `Spell.GetLevel()`
derives from that output plus the base-effect level. `UISpellInformation.SetSpellLevel()` calls
`Spell.SetLevel()`, but that member only recomputes cost — it owns no persistent per-spell level.
The truthful mutation is `IntVariable.SetValue(int)` (`0x060015AC`) on the one variable behind
`Player.GetSpellOutputLevel()`, read with `AsInt()` (`0x060015AE`) and bounded by
`Player.maxSpellOutputLevel` (`0x04000420`). Valid input is `1..maximum`, and it moves every spell at
once; a per-spell output level does not exist to be set.

### Augments are replaced whole

`Spell.SetAugmentGlyphs(StackedIdRecord<GlyphSO>)` (`0x06000FAC`) replaces both the UUID-reference
stack and the resolved-glyph stack, invokes `SpellRecipeSO.LoadGlyphs`, then recomputes spell cost.
There is no add-one or remove-one member: pass the complete intended stack, built through
`AbstractStackedRecord<GlyphSO, IdReference<GlyphSO>>.Set(GlyphSO, int)` (`0x060029E8`), and an empty
record clears. Read it back through `Spell.GetAugmentGlyphs()` (`0x06001075`) and
`Spell.GetQuantityOfGlyph(GlyphSO)` (`0x06001049`).

Admission is per glyph and then combined:

| Term | Member |
|---|---|
| exact glyph | `GlyphSO.All` (`0x040006D9`) |
| available | `GlyphSO.IsAvailable()` (`0x06000BB6`) |
| is an augment | `GlyphSO.IsSpellAugment()` (`0x06000BB8`) |
| count ceiling | `GlyphSO.GetMaxUsages()` (`0x06000BCE`) |
| combined compatibility | `GlyphSO.MeetsNonLvRequirements(List<GlyphSO>, Spell)` (`0x06000C0E`) |
| required mastery | `GlyphSO.GetMasterReqOfList(List<GlyphSO>)` (`0x06000C09`) against `Spell.GetRecipeMasteryLevel()` (`0x06001047`) |

The two combined predicates take the **expanded** list — counts unrolled into repeated entries — not
a distinct set. Passing distinct glyphs understates the stack and admits compositions the game
refuses.

---

## Equipped-spell removal and reorder

`Spell.CanRemove()` (`0x06001038`) is the player-facing gate; its IL consults
`Spell.IsChargeAvailable()` and then `Spell.IsCasting()`. `SpellManager.RemoveSpell(Spell)`
(`0x0600074C`) is more permissive: it removes the instance from `activeSpells`, calls
`Spell.Destroy()`, then `SpellManager.RecomputeSpellWeight()`, and carries its own warning and
recharge reconciliation for non-ready spells. Driving the manager without `CanRemove` reaches states
the interface refuses to produce.

Reorder is a swap, not an insert. `UISpellList.OnDrop` (`0x06002701`) checks
`DragDropContext.ListsMatch()` and `IndicesMatch()`, then calls
`AbstractListVariable<Spell>.SwapPositions(source, destination)` and `UpdateObservable()`
(`0x060014ED`). Empty slots take part, so moving into a hole exchanges the hole rather than
compacting the list.

Whether a removal leaves a hole or compacts is not an assumed invariant: read the raw slot sequence
including empties and compare identities, not counts. `Spell.IsEmpty()` (`0x06001027`) distinguishes
an empty slot, and `Spell.GetName()` (`0x06001087`) is diagnostics.

---

## Targeting requests

`TargetingManager` exposes one queue-head request at a time through `IsTargeting()` (`0x06000770`)
and `GetTargetingLink()` (`0x06000771`); `TargetingManager.RequestTarget` (`0x0600076E`) is what
opens one. `TargetLink.GetAllTargets()` (`0x06003268`) evaluates the authored selection and scaling,
and in this build `StructureSO` is the only direct `Targeting.ITargetable` implementer.

| Verb | Route | Constraint |
|---|---|---|
| submit | `TargetingManager.SubmitTarget` (`0x06000775`) | re-resolve the UUID inside the current `GetAllTargets` result and re-run `TargetLink.CheckTarget` (`0x0600326B`) immediately before calling |
| randomize | `UITargetingInterface.Randomize` (`0x0600276E`) → `TargetLink.GetRandom` → `SubmitTarget` | terminal submission, not a candidate shuffle |
| cancel | link `resultInfo` (`0x04001A96`) → `EffectResultInfo.Cancel` (`0x06001BFC`) | `UITargetingInterface.Close` (`0x0600276C`) closes presentation and calls no `RemoveRequest` |

`SubmitTarget` assigns the supplied object **before** removing the queue head, so the settled shape
is the link's private `target` (`0x04001A94`) holding that exact object, `HasTarget` (`0x06003265`)
true, and the original link no longer current. Cancel marks the owning result cancelled and retires
its target links — one result can own several, and all of them go.

The candidate list and `CheckTarget` are the only authority here, and a request is transient by
construction: both have to be re-read at the moment of submission.

---

## Equipment loadout

`EquipmentSO.Discover` (`0x06000B10`) calls `EquipmentSO.Create` (`0x06000B11`), which sets the
asset's `isCreated` state and emits the game's observables, audio and popup. It equips nothing;
creation and equipping are separate transactions.

The loadout interface reaches `EquipmentManager.ToggleItem(Guid/EquipmentSO)`
(`0x06000514`/`0x06000515`) and from there the exact object overloads `EquipItem(EquipmentSO)`
(`0x06000517`) or `UnEquipItem(EquipmentSO)` (`0x06000519`).

### Equip clamps three ways

```text
EquipItem(EquipmentSO)
  → equipment.GetUsageCost().HasEnough()
  → for an absent target, reject a globally full equippedEquipment list
  → remaining stacks  = GetMaxLevel() - GetStacks(target)
  → affordable stacks = Floor(GetUsageCost().MaximumCostTimes()).ToInt()
  → amount = min(GlobalVariables.GetMultiBuy(), remaining stacks, affordable stacks)
  → equippedEquipment.Stack(target, amount)
  → refresh the native stack observer
  → equipment.Equip(equippedEquipment.GetStacks(target))
  → native audio
```

The manager commits whatever that clamp allows, which can be fewer stacks than asked for.

**`UIEquipmentItem.CanEquip` (`0x060023C3`) owns one admission rule the manager does not.** For a new
target, `HasTypeRoom` (`0x060023C4`) requires both a global slot and
`GetTypesEquipped(primaryType) < primaryType.GetMaxTypeSlots()`. Calling the manager without
reproducing that guard reaches a loadout the interface refuses to produce.

`EquipmentSO.Equip(int)` (`0x06000B12`) applies the resulting **total** stack level, not a delta: a
positive level reserves `GetUsageCost() * equippedLevel`, applies effects, and starts or
quick-completes attunement, while zero removes the UUID-keyed usage reservation and effects and
clears attunement. Usage is a standing reservation, not a purchase ledger.

Unequip checks `IsEquipped`, clamps the removal by live multi-buy and current stacks, un-stacks the
exact target, refreshes the observer, calls `EquipmentSO.Equip(remaining)` and plays audio. It
accepts no arbitrary amount; the native shape is one player click.

---

## Challenges

### Identity and state

`ChallengeSO.ChallengeState` is a fixed five-value enum:

| Value | Member | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | `None` | idle, neither queued nor active |
| 1 | `QueuedStart` | selected to activate at the next applicable transition |
| 2 | `CurrentlyActive` | active and applying its authored effects |
| 3 | `Passed` | completed successfully |
| 4 | `Failed` | abandoned or otherwise failed |

The read side of a challenge row is `IsAvailableToRun()`, `IsCompletedOnce()` and `IsMaxLevel()`
beside its level, cap, seen and reward flags, and its next difficulty and next base reward. The
selection cap, reroll count and fetched flags belong to the managers and lists, not to the
challenge.

### Surface

| Verb | Route | Admission |
|---|---|---|
| select / unselect | `UIChallengeItem.ToggleSelection` (`0x0600224E`) → `ChallengeListVariable.Toggle` on the preferred list | target is in the current Time or prestige offer list, `HasEmptySpot`, and `IsChallengeRestricted(target)` false |
| queue / unqueue | `UIChallengeItem.ToggleActivate` (`0x0600224C`) → `ChallengeSO.ToggleQueueActivation` (`0x06000936`) | currently offered, and state `None` or `QueuedStart` |
| abandon | `UIChallengeItem.AbandonActivation` (`0x0600224D`) → `ChallengeSO.AbandonChallenge` (`0x06000937`) | state `CurrentlyActive`; the requested terminal state is `Failed` |
| fetch Time offers | `UITimeScreenManager.FetchNewChallenges` (`0x06002444`) → `ChallengeManager.LoadNewActiveChallenges` (`0x060004DA`) | first fetch, or a positive reroll count |
| fetch prestige offers | `UIPersistentResetModal.FetchNewChallenges` (`0x060024EE`) → `PersistentResetManager.FetchNewChallenges` (`0x06000653`) | first fetch, or a positive reroll count |

`UIChallengeItem.FireActionButton` (`0x0600224B`) is the row's one button: its inactive branch
queues and its active branch abandons. Unselecting stays available when the selection list is full or
the target would now conflict — those gates admit the selecting direction only.

### The fetch bookkeeping lives in the UI, not the manager

Both UI fetch methods set `hasFetchedChallenges` on the first fetch, or decrement
`challengeRerollsLeft` on later ones, **before** calling their native offer callback. The manager
pipelines contain no such bookkeeping, so re-driving a manager alone silently hands out free fetches.

Both native fetchers call `ChallengeListVariable.CycleOut` (`0x06001634`) before `Instantiate`
(`0x06001631`), and `Instantiate` calls `ChallengeSO.QueueActivation` (`0x06000935`). A landed fetch
therefore has an observable shape: the requested offer list is non-empty and every materialized offer
is in `QueuedStart`. A list counter alone does not prove it.

Neither fetch needs its screen rendered; the UI methods are only the flag-and-reroll wrapper around
the manager pipeline.

---

## Persistent reset

`PersistentResetManager.PersistentReset` (`0x06000651`) is presentation plus a callback: it
references `UIScreenFlash.FadeIn` and installs `PersistentResetLogic` (`0x06000652`) as the
animation-complete callback. The fade is neither gameplay admission nor part of the transaction
identity. The private method is the transaction:

```text
PersistentResetLogic()
  → SetupPersistentValues()
  → GameManager.PersistentResetGameState()
  → ChallengeListVariable.ActivateRewards()
  → ChallengeListVariable.Activate()
  → SetPersistentResource()
  → GameManager.CleanGame()          // reloads the active scene
```

Every native reference dies inside that call. The reset also has no price: there is no cost or
affordability term anywhere on the path.

Its admission is two authored booleans, and their binding is **unproven**.
`UIPersistentResetModal.ResetWorldInteractable` reads two authored `BoolVariable` fields named
`hasCompleteWorldCycle` and `hasFetchedChallenges`, and `PersistentResetManager` exposes fields with
the same names and types — but assembly metadata cannot prove the prefab references point at the
same two assets. A manager-side read is the screen-independent *analogue* of the modal's gate, not a
proven equivalent; settling it needs the shipped prefab or a comparison observed in game.
