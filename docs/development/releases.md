# Public release checklist

[Runtime validation](../testing/runtime-validation.md) ·
[Release procedure](../releasing.md)

Every change reaches `main` through a PR. An ordinary merged PR publishes a
game-free beta when the current stable tag exists. A PR titled `release: ...`
that advances `VERSION` and adds its curated changelog section is the full
promotion. GitHub Actions alone creates tags and releases.

## Release PR

The maintainer writes the release PR by hand. It changes only the two tracked
version authorities:

- `VERSION`: one stable SemVer greater than the newest stable `suite-v` tag;
- `CHANGELOG.md`: one matching, dated, player-facing release section.

There is no `Unreleased` section and no promotion helper. The PR title starts
exactly with `release:`. Configure the `release-policy` status check as required
so ordinary PRs cannot change either file. Squash-merge the approved PR without
changing its title; the main-push policy uses the squash subject as a second
ownership check.

## Candidate review

Before approval, record:

- the exact commit and intended stable version;
- audited game, BepInEx, and source-assembly hashes;
- portable, profile, refs-contract, installed-contract, and interactive evidence;
- Release zero-profile-string evidence;
- Release and perf-debug asset names and SHA-256 values;
- configuration schema and reconciled test, contract, exemption, entity, and
  compiler-warning counts; and
- known limitations and validation scope.

Run portable tests first and installed contracts second, never in parallel.
Install and playtest with `./script/install release`; it installs the same kind
of refs-built Release artifact that CI publishes. Hand-written test stubs are
never an installation or publication input.

Installed contracts remain the private real-game proof. The
`ReleaseAssemblyCheck` comparison runs only with a regenerated refs closure;
see [reference-change faithfulness](../releasing.md#reference-change-faithfulness).

## CI publication review

For every main push, confirm the workflow:

- passed portable, profile, refs-contract, required promotion-policy, and
  manifest-based hygiene gates without a game installation;
- built `OrbModSuite-release.dll` and `OrbModSuite-perf-debug.dll` from refs;
- proved the Release flavor contains zero profiling components; and
- refused any pre-existing target tag or release.

If `suite-v<VERSION>` exists, verify a prerelease tag
`suite-v<VERSION>+main.<N>` whose count comes from the newest stable tag and
whose notes use the associated PR body or merge-message fallback. If the stable
tag is absent, verify stable tag `suite-v<VERSION>` and notes from the matching
changelog section.

`script/package` remains a local archive rehearsal, not a publication owner.
For partial tags or transient failures, follow the
[recovery runbook](../releasing.md#recovery-runbook).
