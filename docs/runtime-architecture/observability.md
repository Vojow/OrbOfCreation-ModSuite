# Service-cycle observability

The four observation products, their artifacts and retention, and how to read a capture.

[Back to dossier](README.md) · [Service-cycle runtime](service-cycle-runtime.md)

## Four systems, four mandates

Per [the north star](../north-star.md), observability is four systems and each has one job. That
document wins wherever this one drifts from it.

1. **Profiler** — debug builds only, compiled out of release entirely. Measured spans over every
   pump-frame phase and worker stage, reported through the dashboard script. Internal tooling;
   pre-allocation is welcome here as a performance detail.
2. **Full trace** — the bug-report recorder, available in release builds: record, reproduce, share the
   artifact. Its mandate is four streams — raw capture data, configuration publications, strategy
   publications, action outcomes — plus the runtime events needed to follow a session. Near-zero cost
   while idle; extra cost and allocation are acceptable while recording, and in debug builds its own
   overhead must never appear inside profiler spans. **What exists records three of the four:** the
   raw-capture stream has no store, an open decision filed under [deferrals](deferrals.md).
3. **Decision log** — always on, high signal, low noise: lifecycle boundaries, strategy changes,
   configuration saves, emergency stops, service health transitions, and one compact sentinel per
   attempted action rather than accounting summaries. The
   mandate is that the suite — BepInEx's own logs included — keeps at most ~100 MB on disk however long
   it runs unattended. The journal has a 64 MiB envelope and routine action success/no-op narration
   is absent; BepInEx still owns `LogOutput.log` retention, so the combined mandate is not a hard
   suite-enforced cap.
4. **Replay** — retired as a runtime system. Hand-crafted scenario fixtures serve its testing value,
   and the full trace records exactly the inputs a future recompute harness would need without the
   runtime carrying a line of machinery for it.

These products share one mechanical foundation: identity value types, atomic file storage, and reusable
block transport. Each owns a separate pool, queue, sleeping writer, control state, format, retention
policy, status, and failure boundary. One product cannot consume another's buffers or backpressure its
producer, and a compact journal never claims to be a complete trace.

| Product | Producer behaviour | Storage behaviour | Disabled behaviour |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full trace | Manual start/stop, exact facts | Complete explicit sessions | No pool or writer |
| Decision journal | Always-on coalesced decisions | Capped rolling retention | Not normally disabled |
| Performance profile | Finite capture in a profiling build | Explicit profile sessions | Absent from normal builds |

## Sizing and transport

Full-trace volume is workload-dependent at schema v7's fixed 288-byte record. It stores every accepted
pump and semantic event, and an active session has no byte or time cutoff. Profiling builds start that
capture automatically so cold-start and sustained-cost evidence is complete; release builds start it
only through the Runtime control. Completed sessions are retained as whole run folders rather than
thinned while live.

The shared transport is a single-producer block lane plus a format-owned writer, encoder, and storage
port — code reuse, not a shared sink. A product with facts from more than one thread owns one lane per
producing thread and merges those ordered lanes on its background writer; it never upgrades the hot
path to a contended multi-producer queue.

Block counts are throughput headroom, not retention — the full trace's ten reusable ~1 MiB blocks are
roughly nine minutes of pending data. Exhausting every empty block is an explicit storage failure
(`AcceptedAndBufferExhausted`, faulting at the next sequence, with the accepted record never retried),
not a reason to block gameplay or grow memory without bound. Backpressure, overwrite, or storage
failure stops only the affected session, commits explicit incomplete or gap evidence where possible,
and never changes gameplay. Unity never waits for diagnostics, telemetry, or I/O, and Orb Mod Config
only invokes each mode's neutral control port and renders status — it never owns a pump, worker,
exporter, or filesystem path.

## Mode 1: manual full trace

The Runtime page provides momentary **Start full trace** and **Stop trace** controls plus state,
duration, bytes written, segment count, and any failure result, distinguishing `Arming`, `Recording`,
`Stopping`, `Complete`, and `Incomplete`. In a release build that control is the only way a trace
begins; a profiling build starts one automatically at construction alongside the profile, which is also
the only way the cold-start frames are observable at all.

A full trace retains every semantic service-cycle event and accepted pump summary; the configuration
and strategy publications a cycle pinned and the outcome of every action it dispatched, under that
cycle's identity; the feature's own numeric projection where one is written; session and segment fences
sufficient to validate order and cross-segment causal parents; and an explicit completeness
classification. It does **not** retain the raw world capture.

Schema v7 names all four generations a cycle pinned. The pump summary carries how many cycles the frame
started and how many services the world-freshness gate held: `0 started / 3 held` is a stalled
collector and `0 started / 0 held` is an idle suite, and the two are indistinguishable without both.
Capture and action facts also name the pump frame they ran inside, on the frame-identity offset the
record already reserved. That field is optional on those kinds, because the same facts can be emitted
from a host control transition between frames — an emergency stop rejecting live batches belongs to no
frame and says so by carrying none. Frame zero is legal, so absence is the field's absence and never a
zero value.

### Artifacts

Format v1 publishes `segment-{ordinal}.oscs` files with a 96-byte header, at most 3,640 unchanged
schema-v7 records, and a 48-byte footer with exact terminal sequence fences and an IEEE CRC32, so each
full segment stays below 1 MiB. The final fixed 160-byte `manifest.oscm` records the two independent
session identities, topology, accepted and durable counts, committed bytes, timestamps, explicit
terminal reason, first missing transport and semantic sequences, and the permanent `DiagnosticOnly`
eligibility. **The manifest publishes only after all accepted blocks drain; its absence means an
interrupted session, never an inferred success.** The writer atomically claims a new `session-{id}`
directory, flushes each file under a temporary name, then publishes it with a no-overwrite rename.
Ordinals are dense, sessions are never resumed or pruned automatically, and initialization or
manifest-publication failure leaves the durable segments unmodified with no manifest — there is no
recovery path that fabricates terminal evidence.

**Generation-keyed publication stores.** The semantic stream says which generation a cycle decided
against, not what that generation held. A recording session writes `configuration-<generation>.oscv`
and `strategy-<generation>.oscv` beside its segments the first time it sees each generation, so three
services deciding on one configuration cost one payload — which is what makes the artifact
self-contained. Store files are UTF-8: a header line of `OSCV <version> <store> <generation-hex>`, then
sorted `path = value` lines. Text and reflected rather than a fixed-width codec, because these
publications are settings trees that grow with the suite and a hand-written codec would silently stop
recording what was added last; sorting means two generations diff to what actually changed. A failed
store write stops storing and does not stop the recording.

**The session roster.** A fixed record identifies a service by a number, and a number tells a reader
nothing, so a recording writes `roster.oscr` once, before the manifest seals the session — UTF-8, a
header line of `OSCR <version> <count>` and `<kind> <identity> <machine-id> = <display name>` rows.
Rows are kinded rather than assumed to be services, because the same question is coming for the
configuration and strategy publications. A service with no display name keeps its registered identity
rather than being left out, so an unnamed feature reads as `orbautomata.auto-agromancy` — true, and
visibly missing a name — instead of "Service 4", which would look finished while saying nothing. A
roster that cannot be written or parsed costs the names and nothing else. Both artifacts sharing the
session format carry it, including the in-game ring dump.

## Mode 1b: the recent-event ring

The suite always holds its most recent semantic events — 8,192 of them, a few megabytes — in a fixed
ring attached to the pump at composition. It never writes to disk on its own; the Runtime page's **Dump
recent events** control turns the ring into an artifact under `trace/run-<timestamp>/recent/`. The
status names the artifact, the event count, and how many older events the ring had dropped, because a
bounded ring may lose history but may not lose it silently. What the ring buys is that the events
leading up to a problem exist when a user notices it, rather than only after they reproduce it under an
armed session. A dump is the same `OSCS`/`OSCM` pair an armed session produces, so the analysis tool
reads one without knowing it is a dump; it lands in `recent/` rather than `full/`, because the
dashboard correlates exactly one full session with the profile beside it and a dump is neither.

Saved Game MCP screenshots in profiling builds are bounded before they reach the synchronous Unity
capture path: the active run admits at most two owned `mcp-*.png` files. It rejects the third request
before framebuffer capture and rejects an encoded image before file creation when the family would
cross its fixed 6 MiB envelope. Inspection or write failures are command faults, not silent drops.

Recording has no elapsed-time or byte cutoff. It ends on the user's stop command, runtime shutdown,
storage or backpressure failure, or semantic corruption; a session is never truncated and no completed
session is pruned in part.

**Retention** bounds the number of `trace/run-<timestamp>/` folders. Full trace and performance profile
write one per process launch; the always-on journal does not. Each launch prunes the oldest until at
most eight remain, counting the folder that launch may write. Folders go whole, because a surviving one
must still be the correlated full/profile pair the analysis tool requires, which pruning by file or
byte budget would destroy. The name is a fixed-width UTC timestamp, so oldest means oldest by name
rather than by a filesystem timestamp a copy would not preserve. A folder that cannot be deleted is
left for the next launch: retention never denies the suite its own recording.

At startup the suite also owns the retired stable `trace/full`, stable `trace/profile`, and
`replay/auto-harvest` layouts. It deletes only files whose exact retired path, extension, and four-byte
format magic agree, then removes empty directories and emits one aggregate line. Unrecognized entries
remain and make that line a warning.

Starting mid-game is valid for diagnosis but does not root the session at a known initial state, so the
manifest marks such a session `DiagnosticOnly`.

## Mode 2: compact service decision journal

The journal records worker and terminal meaning rather than frames. An action-bearing cycle writes one
fixed numeric record per attempted action: service and action ordinal, cycle and monotonic time,
candidate UUID, exact native type ID, list UUID, view UUID, route status, and one packed
disposition/result code. Actions without a native candidate use an explicit `NotApplicable` identity;
an attribution failure does not gate gameplay: the action executes, the record uses the distinct
`AttributionFailed` route, and one repeat-collapsible error line names the service and failure reason.
Native objects and rich strings never enter the journal.

Zero-action decisions retain one outcome kind/code and fault range. Consecutive equivalent decisions
coalesce into one span with first/last time, cycle range, and repeat count; action records never
coalesce. When a cycle has action records its ordinary aggregate terminal decision is omitted, because
each action sentinel already carries the authoritative result and duplicate batch accounting has no
consumer. A fault-bearing terminal remains as a fault-priority decision record beside its action.
Lifecycle, configuration, strategy, emergency, and world-gate transitions remain explicit records.

**Retention.** The fixed budget is 64 MiB. A maximum segment is 80 header bytes plus 128 fixed
80-byte records plus a 40-byte footer, or 10,360 bytes. Production derives a retained limit of 6,476
segments from that byte budget, leaving room for one maximum-sized temporary segment during atomic
commit and oldest-first eviction. Retained full segments occupy 67,091,360 bytes; the maximum write
transition occupies 67,101,720 bytes, below 67,108,864. Partial checkpoint segments only reduce that
total.

**Format.** Journal schema 3 uses one fixed 80-byte numeric record. Each `OSJD` segment has an 80-byte
envelope, at most 128 records, and a 40-byte `OSJF` footer with exact run/ordinal/sequence fences and an
IEEE CRC32 — a separate format and sink from `OSCS`. Decision records retain service ordinal,
lifecycle, cycle/time range, repeat count, one decision outcome, and failure occurrence range. Action
records spend their fixed key space on exact target/routing attribution and one postcondition-backed
outcome. Wake policy, projections, requested/committed/published counts, and native-call/mutation
ledgers are not computed for this artifact; deeper timing and accounting remain in the explicitly
armed semantic trace.

Configuration, strategy, lifecycle, world-gate, and emergency transitions use explicit record kinds
rather than pretending to be cycles. Lifecycle and world-gate transitions carry their service;
configuration, strategy, and emergency transitions carry none, because the thing that changed is the
suite's — and being suite-wide, such a record closes every open decision span before itself. Lifecycle
code `1` means requested and `2` activated. A service the world-freshness gate holds closed reaches the
journal as its own kind: code `1` means the live world was collected before the service's own last
action attempt, `2` that no source could answer. A hold is one record however long it lasts, so a hold
that never ends is one record whose missing successor is the stall itself; without it a stalled suite
would be an absence of evidence rather than evidence.

The journal claims `BepInEx/config/OrbOfCreation-ModSuite/trace/journal` once per process, deliberately
stable across launches rather than nested under a `run-<timestamp>/` folder: the rolling segment cap and
the restart reconciliation both govern one directory, so a per-launch directory would hand every launch
a fresh budget and leave reconciliation nothing to reconcile — which is why the correlated-capture
reader resolves the journal beside a run folder rather than inside it. A store this build cannot
continue is deleted, counted as discarded, and restarted at ordinal zero, because the directory
outlives the process and refusing it would leave the journal permanently dead on that machine; the
discarded count reaches the log once, loudly, and stays on the status card. A storage or observer fault
detaches the journal and leaves scheduling, mutation, and any separately owned semantic trace running.
There is deliberately no configuration toggle for the normal journal, and no restart or fallback path.

## Other owned output paths

The suite does not use `LogOutput.log` as an action ledger. Verified successes and ordinary preflight
no-actions emit no per-action line; the action journal and Runtime outcome projection own those facts.
A submitted mutation whose postcondition does not hold emits one warning. Lifecycle/startup/shutdown
messages remain, and an actual adapter failure or native refusal emits one actionable line with stable
identity and reason. Auto Buy's classified refusal responder owns the `NotAdmissible` line so narration
cannot duplicate it.

Auto Buy affordability drift remains a loud refusal but does not synchronously render or write a
bundle. Structural contradictions that disable the feature retain a full text bundle under
`trace/diagnostics`, capped before each write at eight owned files and 1 MiB total. A collision,
oversized bundle, inspection failure, or retention failure leaves the refusal loud and names the
bundle as unavailable rather than overwriting evidence or faulting gameplay.

## Mode 3: opt-in performance profile

Profiling is finite, aggregate-first, and compile-time optional. Ordinary builds do not define the
profiling symbol, so probe call sites and their arguments are omitted: no branch, timestamp read,
counter, allocation, buffer construction, or writer startup. `EnableServiceCycleProfiler=true` is the
only profiling build switch and defines `SERVICE_CYCLE_PROFILE` before every project is evaluated. An
ordinary-build structural test inspects the compiled code and rejects profiler types, composition,
probe calls, buffers, worker startup, or profile-only timestamp reads — compile-time absence is
evidence, not a runtime no-op.

**Format.** Profile v1 is independent of the trace and journal. Each `OSPS` segment has a 128-byte
envelope, at most 4,096 fixed 144-byte numeric records, and a 40-byte `OSPF` footer with dense
session/ordinal/sequence fences and an IEEE CRC32. A terminal 160-byte `OSPM` manifest declares
calibration, build identity, trace/allocation flags, accepted and durable counts, the first missing
sequence, segment bytes, and complete or incomplete termination; no manifest means interrupted
evidence, never inferred complete. Sessions publish as `session-{id}` directories of dense
`segment-{ordinal}.osps` files under
`BepInEx/config/OrbOfCreation-ModSuite/trace/run-<timestamp>/profile/`, in that launch's own run folder
beside the full trace it correlates with.

Records are tagged aggregates or sparse samples, both retaining a neutral numeric stage code, service
ordinal, lifecycle temperature, raw tick range, allocation evidence, and the exact eight-counter
operation signature. Impossible summaries and unknown tags fail closed. When allocation probing is
unavailable the session flag says so, every encoded allocation total must be zero, and reports must
render `Unavailable` rather than measured zero.

**Stage codes** come from one enumeration, `ServiceCycleProfileSpan`, read by the runtime, the services
and the analysis tool alike. The numbers are wire values, so **a retired span's number is burned rather
than reused** and the blocks stay non-contiguous: 1–999 the suite runtime, 1000–1999 Auto Harvest,
2000–2999 Auto Buy. The frame's own phases are measured alongside the whole pump, and a frame
reconciles lifecycle twice, so that span is two occurrences per frame. Worker stages remain unmeasured:
the probe is owner-thread affine and a worker definition may hold no runtime-owned storage.

A span the enumeration marks as observer overhead — the three semantic-emission spans — is subtracted
from every enclosing span before it is recorded. The full trace emits from inside the frame, so without
that fence `Overall pump` would report the cost of recording the frame rather than the cost of the
frame, which is exactly the red herring the full-trace mandate forbids. The subtraction happens in the
measurement recorder, so the probe API is unchanged and no reader has to know to subtract.

Feature stages live on native adapters, where the main-thread cost is. Every capture snapshots one
temperature before binding and uses it for all its stages, so cold, `LifecycleRebind` and warm work are
never relabelled after a clock began.

This is developer tooling, so delivery favours one understandable path over defensive completeness.
Profiling must not alter gameplay, but the profiler itself may stop and report its first fault. It does
not retry a failed measurement, switch clocks or counters, recover an interrupted session, or accumulate
compatibility fallbacks.

## Reading a capture

`./script/trace` has four modes. `--full` and `--dashboard` resolve their input themselves: a
`full/session-<id>` directory, the `full/` folder holding it, the `run-<timestamp>/` folder that run
wrote, or the trace root holding the run folders. A root resolves to its newest run folder and says on
stderr which one it read and which it skipped; a folder holding two full-trace sessions is an error that
lists them. `--journal` and `--performance` take their own directory directly, because neither is
reachable from a full-trace session.

- **`--full <capture> [report.md]`** validates the manual session and emits one report with separate
  service, pump, and worker/service semantic views. It verifies every segment envelope and checksum,
  dense transport and semantic order, topology, exact cross-segment parent identity and timestamp
  ordering, and the terminal manifest fences, holding at most one bounded segment at a time so memory
  does not limit session duration. A missing manifest is reported as `Interrupted` over the validated
  durable prefix and never promoted to complete. Names come from the session roster when the capture
  wrote one; a capture without one is reported under its numbers rather than having names inferred.
- **`--journal <journal-directory> [report.md]`** selects an explicit third decoder route and never
  sniffs or falls through to the OSCS parser. Persistent ordinals must be contiguous; record sequences
  must be contiguous within a run; every adjacent later run begins at sequence one; and a run identity
  cannot reappear after another run. A nonzero first ordinal is reported as absent retained history, not
  corruption; an interior hole fails closed, because production retention removes only the oldest
  prefix. The report explicitly says OSJD has no terminal manifest, cross-run clock, wall time,
  pump/frame timing, physical worker scheduling, service names, or projection schema.
- **`--performance <session-directory> [report.md]`** validates the manifest and dense segment lineage
  and renders stage, service, temperature, count, average/minimum/maximum microseconds, allocation, and
  operation signatures, reading aggregates for totals and keeping sparse samples in the binary session.
- **`--dashboard <capture> <dashboard.html>`** is the correlated offline projection. It runs the same
  strict readers, selects the newest retained journal run, clips its decision spans to the full-trace
  window, and calibrates profile raw timestamps onto the Common monotonic clock, writing one JSON
  dataset and an HTML viewer. Correlation stays a presentation concern: the three formats, writers,
  terminal states, and failure boundaries remain independent runtime products.

The viewer is organised by service rather than by phase: an overview page spends the pump frame as a
stacked bar per frame — response, capture, action, and whatever the pump measured but did not attribute
— then one page per service, each spending a cycle as capture, handoff, derive, project, and dispatch
from the wire's own timestamps. Derive is labelled *math + allocation*, because no seam exists between
them. A final evidence page keeps the semantic lanes, decision projections, stage aggregates, and the
retained profile samples.

Every pump frame and cycle is classified cold-process, lifecycle-rebind, or warm, and the viewer
defaults to warm only: a first pass carries the JIT and the first touch of every buffer behind it, so
leaving it in an aggregate misreports the steady state by an order of magnitude while excluding it
silently would hide a real cost. Excluded frames are counted and totalled above the charts and one
toggle puts them back. Above roughly 1,500 frames in range the pump chart switches to equal-time
buckets of means and says so. The charting library is vendored and inlined rather than fetched from a
CDN — a dashboard is a file attached to an issue and opened days later on a machine that may have no
network, and a page that renders empty offline is not evidence.

The full trace is the only required evidence. The profile session and the decision journal are optional,
and their absence is a fact about the capture rather than an error — a release build has no `profile/`
session at all. A missing product leaves its panes empty and adds a banner, so the reader is told what
is not there instead of being refused a dashboard.

**What a profile's numbers may and may not be used for.** They are diagnostic elapsed time, not an
uncontaminated CPU or allocation claim, and a profile recorded with the semantic trace active is
measuring both. Aggregate maxima do not retain frame identity, so one wall-clock outlier is not
attributed to game work without a matching sampled record or an external profiler. A trace-off profile
is required before any of it becomes a performance acceptance gate.

## In-game surfaces

Common exposes one owner-thread rolling action-outcome projection for the Runtime page, consuming the
same assembled evidence as the journal before storage coalescing, so it retains exact planned,
committed, skipped, rejected, and faulted totals plus the latest real boundary reason per registered
service. It adds no feature bookkeeping, native read, second service poll, storage path, or disk I/O,
and remains available if journal storage cannot initialize. Its fixed 30-minute action timeline charts
committed actions and fault presence only — planned, skipped, rejected, and waiting evidence never
becomes charted work — and `Source` infrastructure is excluded by typed shape, never by a display-name
match. The Runtime page reduces the pump-timing projection to one average/worst line; full performance
analysis is the offline dashboard.
