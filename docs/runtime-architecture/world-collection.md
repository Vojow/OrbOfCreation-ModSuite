# Shared world collection

One registered service reads the whole game once per interval and publishes an immutable snapshot every
other service consumes. The game is read once, by one reader, at one instant, and the cost is paid once.

[Collection quirks](world-collection-decisions.md)

This document describes the world publication specifically. The rule it serves — a service receives
configuration, world state and strategy and nothing else — is stated in
[service-data-flow.md](service-data-flow.md), which is the authority if the two disagree.

## The pipeline

```

- **Collector** compiles one accessor per member per category against the loaded assembly and answers
  each modifier record the way the game's own accessor would without calling it. It is the only stage
  that touches a native object.
- **Frame** carries raw samples across the thread boundary. It cannot be the collector, because a
  service frame is structurally forbidden from storing delegates and the collector is almost entirely
  delegates.
- **Deriver** turns samples into rows — the ported half of the game's own math, including the full
  resource rate chain — on the worker, holding no native surface to reach for. It is pure and total:
  unreadable arithmetic fails neutral, so a NaN operand yields uncapped, zero-headroom output rather
  than a fabricated bound.
- **Publish action** carries the derived snapshot back to Unity. Publishing is an action rather than
  something the worker does directly, so the live world changes at exactly one point in the pump, on
  one thread, before any service decides anything that frame ([W4](world-collection-decisions.md)).
- **Publisher** swaps the reference under the generation the snapshot was *collected* at. Latest wins;
  nothing published is ever written again.
- **The pin** is the runtime's, not the consumer's. `ServiceCycleStartCoordinator` reads the
  publication once when it opens a cycle and hands that snapshot to both halves, so a service cannot
  evaluate against one snapshot and act against another ([W50](world-collection-decisions.md)).

Six inputs belong to no single entity and are read once per pass into a `WorldFrameGlobals` struct
stamped onto the frame: five player globals — resource overflow, overflow loss, reset time passed,
structure cost percent, attribute quality bonus — plus Unity's fixed delta time.

## Reading rules

**Reproduce the accessor, never call it.** `ValueModifierRecord.GetValue()` calls `Calculate()` when
dirty, which writes `calculatedValue`, clears `calculationDirty`, and re-stamps observables — mutating
game state on the suite's schedule. Every modifier is read as `GetValue()` would answer it and never
through it. This is the memo rule, **D16** below.

**Enumerate the runtime type, not the save record.** A save record describes what was written to disk;
the runtime `ScriptableObject` describes what the game is currently playing. **D17** below.

**A generation is a frame number, and it is the frame the game was read on** — not the frame the
snapshot finished deriving on. Only the first lets a consumer ask "has the world been re-read since I
last changed it" and get the right answer.

**An epoch says which run of the game a snapshot describes.** `CollectedAtEpoch` is stamped at capture
from the lifecycle monitor's generation. A generation says *when*; only the epoch can say the run
itself was replaced ([W55](world-collection-decisions.md)).

**A missing member degrades one category, not the pass.** Binding failures are reported per category in
`WorldCollectionReport` with the member that could not be found, and a build that renamed one field
still publishes the other forty-four. Degradation is per-term and never neutral-by-default
([W28](world-collection-decisions.md)).

## D16 — The suite owns transcribed economy math, gated by an assembly hash

Asking the game to recompute a derived value is not cheap, and the cost is not the reflection.
`StructureSO.GetNextCost()` chains four `ResourceCostList` transforms, each a LINQ projection into a
fresh list, and caches nothing. Measured against the shipped macOS build, evaluating that chain from
the same inputs in suite-owned code is roughly 11.5× faster per structure, bit-identical for every
entity in a real save, and allocates nothing where the game allocates about six lists per call.

Base values are a different matter. `GetQuantity()` returns a field. `ValueModifierRecord.GetValue()` is
reproduced rather than ported, because it is a branch before it is a computation:
`calculationDirty ? Calculate() : calculatedValue`. `Calculate()` runs an allocating LINQ pass over both
modifier dictionaries and then writes four fields of game state — the game recomputing and re-stamping
its own observable at whatever point in the frame the suite's pump happens to run. An accessor that
writes on read is a mutation however innocuous the write looks, and the suite does not mutate game
state outside the action boundary.

**So the reading is the memo rule, and the dirty flag decides it:** a clean record reads as its
`calculatedValue`, a dirty one as `Adjust(baseValue)` over both modifier sets, computed and not stored.
Neither half is the rule alone — see [W5](world-collection-decisions.md), where each half shipped alone
and cost a live failure in the opposite direction. **The number to publish is the number the game will
act on**, which makes this an exact reading rather than a tolerated stale one.

What makes owning the derived math tolerable is the gate, not the speed: the four conditions in
[goals and invariants](goals-and-invariants.md) are load-bearing together. Porting proceeds one layer at
a time, each proven before the next begins — `GetTrueRate()` and `IsAvailable()` remain genuine game
calls for exactly that reason, since stacking a second unverified transcription on an unverified first
would leave no way to attribute a differential failure to either.

## D17 — World collection is derived from the runtime type, never from the save record

Every entity category has two shapes: the `ScriptableObject` it is at runtime, and the
`SaveDataBase<T>` record it serialises into. They are not the same set of fields, and the difference is
exactly the set of values this suite exists to read. A save record carries only what must survive a
restart, so everything the game recomputes on load is absent by construction, and a field list built
from `SaveData`/`ApplyTo` reads as a complete inventory while omitting the entire cached layer. It did:
the first pass over twenty-five categories was derived that way and missed 165 scalars and 125 modifier
records, including all six of `ResourceSO`'s rate terms and the cached `ConsumableSO.quantity` that
answers "how many do I have". The save record is a shortlist of what the game considers *state*, not
the list.

**Enumerate the runtime type.** Walk the declared instance members of the `ScriptableObject` itself,
collect the value-typed ones and the `ValueModifierRecord`s, and justify each omission rather than each
inclusion — the default is that a cached number the game keeps is a number some service will want,
because the game keeps it for the same reason.

**Private is not a signal.** `ConsumableSO.quantity`, `ResourceSO.inLossMode`,
`StructureSO.currentBuildTime` and `DiscoveryTreeSO.totalDiscoveredCount` are all private, all cached,
and all the exact number a consumer needs. Visibility describes the game's encapsulation, not the
value's usefulness, and compiled field accessors do not care.

**A count is a fixed-size fact about a variable-size thing.** An immutable publication cannot carry
`List<RitualEffectInstance>`, and deferring the list is often right; it is never a reason to defer
`ritualInstances.Count`, which is what "is this ritual currently running" actually means. Defer the
elements; collect the cardinality and any scalar the game itself derives from the collection. A
single-valued reference is likewise collectable — a `Guid` is a value type, so `AlchemyTypeSO.selectedLevel`
and every edge like it travels as an identity. Collecting entities but no edges leaves the snapshot
holding numbers it cannot attribute.

**Reachability is an edge the planner needs, not a boundary-only fact.** The snapshot publishes each
candidate's exact category/list/owning-view relation from both `ViewSO.relevantLists` and
`availableLists`, with a named fail-closed row when the relation is missing, unreadable, ambiguous or
contradictory — so the planner excludes content behind an unavailable owning view instead of
repeatedly proposing work only the action boundary can refuse. The boundary rebuilds the same
relation from live native objects immediately before payment.

**Do not sort members into runtime state and definition constants.** The tempting fourth rule is to skip
fields the game never writes. It was measured and rejected: classifying the 270 members remaining after
the first three rules by whether the declaring type assigns them put 186 in "runtime" and 84 in
"definition", and the definition bucket contained `HarvestElementSO.harvestRate` and
`AlchemyRecipeSO.cachedRequiredXp`. A per-member IL audit may supersede an orphan only when an exact
game-owned accessor replaces it, as `GetRequiredExperience()` does for required experience — a rule
whose failure mode is silently dropping an externally maintained value is the rule this decision exists
to replace. The reads are compiled delegates; the price is a wider row, and a wider row is the cheap
side of this trade.

**A record that distributes is not a record that holds.** `OrderedMultiplierRecord` and
`MergingModifierRecord` derive from `ModifierRecord`, not `ValueModifierRecord`, and have no cached
value — they push modifiers, transformed, into the member records handed to them by `AddRecord`, so the
distributed effect reaches the snapshot through those members under the memo rule. What the distributor
alone knows is its own total, the `Adjust(100)` its tooltip prints as a percentage; `Adjust` is pure, so
computing it would not breach D16, but it needs the two variable-size modifier dictionaries. Until a
named service wants that number, the row carries the active-modifier count.

**A reading the chain cannot price honestly publishes no price.** A zero `attributeCostMod` is
authored at parity, so whatever produced the zero, multiplying by it makes the entity free — the one
error direction that commits a consumer to a purchase it cannot pay for. A zero quality is the same
refusal from the other side, being the base of the power the modifier is divided by, and would
price at infinity. Either way the entity publishes no price, and a consumer that finds none falls
back rather than reading a zero as cheap.

## What is deliberately not collected

An immutable publication may not carry a list, and wrapping each list in an audited table is a
per-category design decision rather than a mechanical one. So the scalar half of these categories is
collected and the list half is not:

| Category | Not carried |
| --- | --- |
| Ritual | `ritualInstances`, `currentSpoils` |
| Plot node | `sizeMods` |
| Discovery tree | the discovered-identity list |

This is stated rather than silently omitted, because a consumer that assumed a row described its entity
completely would be wrong about exactly the part that says how many are in stock. Three cases that look
like they belong on that list do not:

- **A consumable's stock count.** The save record stores a `consumableCounts` list and derives the total
  on load; the runtime keeps that total in a plain cached int, and `Quantity` carries it.
- **A plot node's phase quantities.** `IdleQuantity` and `TotalQuantity` are summed out of
  `phaseInstances` during collection and `RemainingQuantity` derived on the worker, so the numbers
  travel while the instances do not. The game's own accessors are *not* how they are read: both reach
  the list through `GetPhaseInstance()`, which lazily caches and creates a missing instance, and
  collection does not write ([W35](world-collection-decisions.md)).
- **A plot's action instances.** They travel, one row each in `PlotActionInstances`, keyed by the pair
  and by the instance's position in the plot's own list — that position is the plot's, not a queue's.

**The live action queue** is collected — a queue is a list variable carrying its own uuid — and what is
deliberately absent is not the reading but the *authority*. A collected reading may shape a plan and
may never admit an action into a slot, because services compete for the slots they read
([W53](world-collection-decisions.md)).

## Acting twice on one world

A service that attempts a game-facing action must not decide again until the world has been re-read
since. A commit is absent from the pinned reading; a skip, rejection, or fault is just as important,
because the live action boundary has shown the facts which produced the plan were insufficient or
divergent. Planning another action from those facts means trusting a snapshot just proven unreliable.

The first world is the same problem in different clothes. At activation the published snapshot is the
seed one — an empty world, or a real collection whose prices the game has not finished cooking — and a
service deciding against it decides that nothing costs anything. So the gate is armed at birth too:
`ServiceCycleSlot.ArmWorldGate` raises the floor to the generation live when the runner became current,
at activation and again on lifecycle replacement.

This is enforced by the runtime, not by the services, and there is nothing to declare. The gate is
unconditional: every ordinary service is subject to it and none opts in.
`ServiceCycleSlot.RecordWorldInvalidation` raises the floor after every attempted game-facing dispatch,
whatever its terminal disposition, and `TryStartCycle` refuses to open the next cycle until the
published world generation is strictly newer than the floor. Both numbers are pump frames, so the
comparison is a plain `>`, and the floor only rises, so re-arming never forgives an earlier attempt.

A `Source` is exempt by shape, so collection never waits on itself. That is the only exemption:
committed, skipped, rejected, and faulted ordinary attempts all close the gate. Strictly-after is
deliberate — within a frame, actions dispatch before captures, so a snapshot stamped with our own
action's frame can contain it, but waiting one more collection is cheap next to acting again on
unreliable facts. A world source that cannot answer holds the service closed, because "unknown" is not
"fresh".

Nothing about this lives in a feature. `AutoBuyService.ShouldStart` answers only "is Auto Buy configured
to run". Only the generation crosses the seam (`IServiceWorldGenerationSource`), so this stays a
scheduling rule rather than a second way to read the world, and every held frame is recorded as a
`ServiceWorldGateDeferralFact`, because a held service is otherwise indistinguishable from a service
with nothing to do.

This deliberately couples every consumer to collection's health: if collection stalls, consumers that
have already acted stop acting rather than working from a world that is falling behind. Emergency stop
freezes the generation for the same reason and with the same effect.

## Layout

One file per category under `src/Common/Runtime/World/Categories/`, each holding that category's row
struct and its binder. The machinery lives one directory up: `WorldCategoryMachinery.cs` (buffers,
readers, derivers), `NativeAccessorBinder.cs` (member binding), `GameWorldCollector.cs` (the pass, and
owner of the 45-reader array), `GameWorldStateDeriver.cs` (the four derived row kinds — resource,
structure, upgrade, plot node).

Three readers are **structural**: plot authoring, effect blocks, and entity requirements describe what
the game's authors wrote rather than what the player has done, so they re-read only when the frame
arrives under a lifecycle epoch this collector has not already read for.

Most tables are one row per entity and are walked by the identity check. Which tables the walk skips is
stated in exactly one place — `NotIdentityTables` in
`tests/OrbModding.Tests/Runtime/Verification/WorldIdentityWalkTests.cs`, currently 23 names — because
every second reading of an entity another table already claims lands there. Five exclusions have reasons
worth knowing:

- **Purchase costs.** `WorldPurchaseCost.cs` is a second walk of the structure registry with a buffer
  admitting several rows per entity, and `WorldUpgradeCost.cs` the matching second walk of the upgrade
  registry appending into the same buffer — which is why the collector, not either reader, resets it.
  Read through `WorldPurchaseCostLookup`, which returns an entity's whole range, because a partial price
  is worse than none.
- **Plot actions.** A row is a *pair*, so it has no identity of its own. `WorldPlotAction.cs` walks the
  plot registry a second time and prices each pair against the plot's remaining quantity on the worker;
  read it through `WorldPlotActionLookup`, which searches the composite key.
- **Action queue slots.** `WorldActionQueue.cs` publishes two tables: a queue *is* an entity, so
  `ActionQueues` is walked like any other identity table, while `ActionQueueSlots` is keyed by queue and
  index and is exempt. Neither is reached by a registry walk — both queues resolve by uuid through the
  identity registry, which keeps the action-manager singleton out of the collector.
- **Entity requirements.** `WorldEntityRequirement.cs` reads every upgrade's and structure's per-level
  prerequisite container, so a row is one condition keyed by an entity its own category already claimed.
  Its list is `[SerializeReference]`, so accessors compile per concrete condition class on first sight,
  and a class that does not bind yields a row of kind `Unknown` rather than none — an unmodelled
  condition must be visible as a requirement nobody can evaluate rather than as an entity with no
  requirements ([W58](world-collection-decisions.md)).
- **Spell slots and costs.** `WorldSpellSlot.cs` publishes the equipped loadout and `WorldSpellCost.cs`
  what casting out of it costs, both from one reader, because a slot's price is only answerable from the
  same equipped instance the slot was read from. Neither is identity-keyed: a position may be unfilled
  and two may hold the same spell, so `SlotIndex` is the key and counts unfilled positions exactly as
  the game does, because it is the number a cast is addressed by
  ([W60](world-collection-decisions.md)).
