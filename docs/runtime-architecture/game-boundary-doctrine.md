## The stance

The suite owns its math and its behavior. The game is the authority on **identity** (what
exists, UUIDs, types), **structure** (relationships, unlock state, serialized graphs), and
**transaction execution** (mutations and their results). Every touch of game code, data, or
assets is a declared schema-3 contract. Nothing the suite does may depend on ambient game-UI
state — which screen is open, what is loaded, what the player happens to be looking at.

The two failure modes this doctrine exists to prevent are not symmetric. A broken declared
contract fails loudly and enumerably at audit time, before anything acts. An undeclared
dependency on UI state fails per-screen, per-session, invisibly. When a choice exists, take
the risk the manifest can see.

### Perf-debug inspection exception

The Game MCP is a debugger, not an ordinary service or a production gameplay dependency. A
parameterized tooltip, inspected panel, active-screen catalog, fixed probe, or framebuffer cannot be
truthfully published as general world state. A perf-debug MCP operation may read that exact fact
directly provided the HTTP worker submits one immutable operation, Unity performs the read on its
main thread, the result is native-free and terminal, and no gameplay mutation occurs. UI state
changes such as navigation or opening an inspected tooltip are classified and audited as UI
mutations, not called read-only.

This exception does not permit speculative capture. There is no periodic MCP snapshot, cache warm,
hidden navigation, or “freshness” loop. Broadly reusable changing facts go into `GameWorldState`;
authored graphs are build-time or lifecycle-structural; genuinely parameterized UI facts are read
only for the request that names them. See
[Game MCP frame operations](game-mcp-frame-operations.md).

## Reads and owned math

- Compute what we can; collect what we cannot. Collection cost is a real budget: every native
  read is main-thread FFI work, and time spent collecting answers we can derive ourselves is
  time the suite does nothing.
- Owned math is verifier-covered. Divergence between suite math and the game's own answers
  must be detectable, loud, and named — never assumed away.
- Never re-derive what only the game can know. `WorldAlchemyRecipe` capturing the natively
  resolved `AlchemyRecipeSO.GetMaxUsageSlots()` instead of interpreting the raw modifier and
  its `-1` sentinel is the paid-for lesson: re-implementing *facts* (as opposed to *formulas*)
  silently diverges when the game changes.
- A published value that requires a screen visit to be fresh is a **collection defect**.
  Either the collector performs the declared revalidation the UI would perform, or the value
  is published as stale-capable and no action may be authorized by it. "Works when the screen
  is open" is never an accepted state.

### Live entity identity catalog

`RuntimeIdentityRegistryBinding` is the one Common-owned binding for
`IdScriptableObject.RuntimeLookup` and `IdScriptableObject.GetGuid()`. Typed registry resolution and
the identity catalog share it; no feature, MCP surface, diagnostic, or log owns another registry or
UUID-to-name reader.

The first shared world capture after `RuntimeReady` in a Playing generation enumerates that registry
once on Unity's main thread. The pass records lifecycle generation and registry count before and
after enumeration, requires every value's `GetGuid()` to equal its dictionary key, and copies only
UUID, exact runtime type, `TooltipableObject.GetName()` when applicable, and the Unity asset name.
One entity's name accessor may fail without discarding other identity-correct rows. Any lifecycle or
count instability discards the entire candidate and retries on a later ordinary capture; an identity
contradiction or total binding failure publishes an empty unavailable catalog and reports one error
for that lifecycle. Names never block world publication, a feature, or a mutation.

The successful table is UUID-sorted and immutable. One snapshot reference is attached to every
`GameWorldState` in that lifecycle and placed in a Common latest-wins holder for non-world
presentation consumers; it is not rebuilt per publication and its rows are not copied into entity
categories. A lifecycle transition first replaces both views with an unbound empty snapshot, so no
Unity asset or name survives save/load, reset, NG+, or scene-generation replacement.

`EntityIdentityFormatter` is the sole rendering facade and never reflects or touches Unity. Its
total fallback ladder is live display name, live asset name, generated `KnownEntities` diagnostic
name before the live bind only, then bare canonical UUID. Rendered labels always retain the UUID.
After bind, a missing label reports one UUID-only warning per `(generation, UUID)` and does not fall
back to authored bootstrap metadata. MCP entity references, refusal receipts, feature diagnostics,
logs, and traces all use this same substrate; names remain diagnostics and never identity authority.

Portable and installed-contract gates prove this shape and its exact native members. Stability of
the live registry at `RuntimeReady` remains a supervised promotion check; this lane does not claim
live UAT and does not launch the game.

## Boundary validators and freshness classes

The main thread re-checks live native facts before mutating. Some of the game's own validator
methods are backed by caches that only recompute when a screen views them — the game can be
the stale party while the suite's snapshot is honest. Every native validator used in an
action protocol is therefore classified in its contract dossier:

1. **Pure.** Computes from live state on every call. Trust it.
2. **UI-cached, revalidatable.** Backed by a visibility-driven cache with a known recompute
   path. The action protocol invokes that exact recompute as its own declared, scoped
   contract call immediately before asking — never ambient or blanket cache-touching.
   Warming an unrelated cache has changed game math before; every revalidation is named,
   scoped to its action, and audited.
3. **Unrefreshable or side-effectful.** No safe recompute path exists. Do not pre-validate.
   Attempt the mutation, verify postconditions exactly, and treat a rejection as the answer.
   The one-attempt-per-world rule makes this self-correcting: a stale-validator rejection
   costs one publication, and the next publication is a fresh collection.

Every rejection names the check that refused, in the named-cache vocabulary
(`UpgradeSO.cachedCostLevel` is the naming precedent). "The game said no" is not a reason.

Action dispatch deliberately continues under the cycle-pinned configuration even when a newer
committed generation appears while its batch drains. That staleness is bounded by the batch's
one-or-two-frame execution (normally one or two publications), and configuration has one
player-driven writer operating at human rate; adding a second configuration read or invalidation
path would buy only an imperceptible narrowing window. A future design with long-running batches
changes this invariant and must revisit the decision. Master-disable also releases feature
ownership leases on committed-configuration refresh as a fast backstop, but that is not the
policy-correctness mechanism. This bounded policy staleness does not relax live native
revalidation: game facts can change every frame without bound.

**Staleness probes.** Perf-debug capture QA may, for class-2 contracts, collect the cached
value, force the declared revalidation, and compare. Divergence is a build-behavior finding.
This is the detector for game updates that change caching behavior; a new game baseline
re-runs the probes as part of its audit.

## GameActions: the only way to mutate

Each game capability the suite can perform is defined **once** as a GameAction, and every
consumer — feature services, the Game MCP, tests — uses that one definition. A GameAction
declares:

- its **complete binding set**, resolved and validated at lifecycle scope before any use, so
  a resolution failure is impossible mid-transaction;
- its **preflights**, each with its freshness class;
- the **mutation** itself;
- its **postcondition** — the single simplest observable check that the requested transition
  landed on the requested target (see below);
- its **failure story** — what blocks, what the health surface says when the postcondition
  fails, and, for automation consumers only, what quarantines.

Mutation entry points, in strict order of preference:

1. **A data-layer composite** the game already owns: `UpgradeSO.Purchase`,
   `StructureSO.Purchase`, `SpellManager.FireSpellIndex`,
   `AlchemyInstanceListVariable.AddAlchemyInstances`/`RemoveAlchemyInstances`,
   `PlotNodeActionInstanceListVariable.AddInstance`.
2. **A disciplined re-drive** when the composite exists only inside a UI handler body.
   `SpellLevelNativeAdapter` is the reference implementation: every member prebound and
   validated before the first mutation is possible, the outcome verified by the simplest
   observable check, and irreversible steps (payments) preflighted hardest and taken last.
3. Invoking UI handler methods: **never.**

One evaluation round per world reading; any attempted round raises the world-gate floor.
This is engine-enforced (`ServiceCycleSlot`), not per-feature policy — a GameAction never
carries its own cooldown, retry timer, or candidate memory.

## Suite UI

- The suite owns every control and every pixel it presents. Live native UI objects are never
  cloned, repurposed, or listener-stripped into suite controls.
- Static assets — sprites, fonts, sliced frames — are borrowed through declared capture, like
  any other read. If capture fails, the control does not appear and health names the exact
  reason. There is no fallback rendering.
- Suite surfaces **speak the game's idiom**, not just its palette. If the native siblings of
  a surface are tabs, the suite's addition is a tab; if they are toggle buttons, it is a
  toggle. Interaction grammar is part of looking native.
- The Game MCP navigates suite surfaces exactly as it navigates native ones. A suite surface
  that requires MCP special-casing is wrongly built; fix the surface, not the MCP.

## Enforcement

- Every implementation lane cites this document; review findings reference the specific rule
  violated.
- A new capability is a new GameAction, or an explicitly justified exception recorded in the
  lane report — which then becomes doctrine, so the next feature reuses it instead of
  reinventing it.
- Bespoke per-feature variants of already-solved problems (binding, verification, freshness
  handling, asset capture) are findings, not style choices.
- The Game MCP owns transport only. All stateful tools cross its single post-pump frame-operation
  inbox; an empty inbox performs no projection, health read, native read, or authority refresh.

## Postconditions: one simplest sentinel

A GameAction verifies its outcome with the single simplest observable check that the requested
transition happened to the requested target: stable UUID plus expected native type, plus one
outcome fact — a loadout add checks for the new spell instance, a purchase checks the new level.
Nothing else is computed. Payment deltas, resource balances, counters, timers, and flags are not
gathered as receipt evidence; code that computes values nothing acts on is deleted, not tolerated.
Most actions succeed, the boundary is designed for that, and a layer of paranoia bookkeeping is a
finding, not a safety margin. In particular, an accounting fact can never veto, downgrade, or
quarantine an outcome the game observably performed — a sub-ULP native `BigDouble` subtraction
cannot disprove a transition that happened.

After a native exception, capture the simplest available after-state before classifying: if the
requested identity and outcome are observable, the action committed and the exception rides along
as its explanation; if the outcome is absent or the target ambiguous after a mutation began, fail
closed. Admission checks still prevent unaffordable or otherwise ineligible attempts — this rule
defines what a postcondition is, not preflight authority.

## MCP responses: worked, or why not

A success says the action worked and, when the settlement window delivers it, what changed — the
settled post-state a caller would otherwise need a follow-up read for. Nothing else: no request
echoes, no zero counters, no empty collections, no receipts, no expected/observed generation
pairs, no verbosity options. Absence means not applicable, and each tool has one response shape.

A refusal or fault answers with the exact reason a caller can act on, plus only the facts that
explain that reason. Explaining a failure is not dumping a dossier: an audit stanza that ships
with every failure regardless of relevance is ceremony, and ceremony is deleted.

## The wire speaks the screen's language

What the MCP returns matches what the player sees: a screenshot and the MCP answer for the same
screen agree on names and numbers. Reads answer `available`/`unavailable`; mutations answer
`committed`/`refused`/`faulted`. Every entity reference carries the stable UUID plus the
player-facing name, category or type when relevant, and the internal name only when it differs.
Magnitudes render the way the player recognizes them from the screen; native numeric sentinels
become field absence, never plausible values. Resource and cost rows use one canonical spendable
`amount`; collector and factor internals stay off the player surface.

The format is the simplest one that carries the signal. Compact text is the default whenever an
agent reads it faster than structured data; JSON is for responses whose handles feed the next
call. One vocabulary, one spelling, one numeric rendering per concept, whatever the media.

Read tools carry one `worldGeneration` naming the immutable publication that answered. Action
schemas and results carry none: the GameAction revalidates live, and a committed response's
post-state names the newer settled world it came from.

## The UI defines the verb surface

The native player UI defines the MCP action vocabulary. A compiled manager or UI handler is not by
itself permission to expose a verb: the player must actually be offered that choice. Discovery is
therefore component composition followed by native resolution and confirmation; transient discovery
offers are modes of that same discovery namespace. A loaded spell has no in-place glyph editor, so
glyph layout is chosen before loadout add and baked into the new spell. Casting Output and Reserve
are global dials, not per-spell state. Whenever the MCP cannot bind the exact visible sibling, it
returns `contract_unavailable` rather than substituting a nearby native path.

Spell-loadout add is the concrete complete-candidate case. On the Unity main thread the shared
GameAction builds a temporary spell at the recipe's selected level, bakes the requested glyph
multiset into it, and follows the visible recipe button's gate order: non-level duration/toggle
requirements; authored usage requirements (with the UI's selected-augment override); computed
usage-budget affordability; an empty loadout slot; and unique-spell compatibility. Creation-cost
affordability is then re-read from the exact core-plus-augment composition. After acquiring its
mutation permit, the boundary stages the live selection, reruns those mutable gates, performs the
cost, invokes native creation, and commits only when a new spell with the requested recipe identity
and exact baked glyph multiset is observable. The player's staged Spellcraft selection is restored
to what it was before the action, on every outcome including success. Duplicate request rows count
cumulatively against each glyph's native usable maximum. Core-component spell discovery remains
independently bound, but both verbs use the same complete lifecycle binding set and native recipe
resolver.

Generic compose discovery uses the same component-first rule without retaining a rendered UI page.
The existing category traversal publishes each `IDiscoverable.GetGlyphRecipe()` and
`GetResourceRecipe()` beside its native discovery decision. Preview resolves only among the authored
outputs for the requested player surface and reproduces the UI resolver's count-plus-membership
comparison; zero matches or multiple matches refuse rather than guessing. Confirm carries that
server-derived output and the submitted composition into the canonical GameAction. On the Unity main
thread, before its mutation permit or payment, the action resolves every component by UUID and exact
`GlyphSO`/`ResourceSO` type and rereads both recipe lists from the exact output. A changed or partial
composition refuses. The caller never supplies or selects an output UUID the UI did not expose.

Every MCP gameplay action still uses its capability's canonical GameAction and live Unity-main-thread
revalidation. A failed player-driven attempt returns its exact failure and leaves no MCP-owned
lifecycle quarantine; the next request revalidates live again. This does not relax automation safety
policy, and MCP capability registration does not depend on whether the owning automation is enabled.

All committed gameplay actions pass through one post-state settlement path. It waits up to one
second for a shared world publication strictly newer than the world used for mutation admission,
then delegates to one command-to-world projector. The successful response stamps that observed
`worldGeneration` and returns the complete next-decision state. If no newer publication arrives, the
response stays `committed` and emits one exceptional `postStateUnavailable` fact with
`reasonCode=post_state_timeout` — it never labels an older world as committed state and never adds a
ceremonial lag explanation. Navigation uses the same one-second freshness rule for the arrived UI
state. Domain-specific readiness may strengthen the shared predicate only when the requested outcome
is event-driven, as discovery offers are.
