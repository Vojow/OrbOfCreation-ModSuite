# Troubleshooting

[Back to documentation](../README.md) · [Installation](installation.md) ·
[Configuration](configuration.md) · [Uninstalling](uninstalling.md)

When the suite loads, `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` records **Orb Of Creation ModSuite** once. Start with
that file for installation problems. For problems after startup, use **Mods > Runtime > Create bug
report** immediately after the issue so the report includes the most useful recent evidence.

## The suite entered compatibility quarantine after a game update

The suite uses audited game assemblies for its economy calculations. An unknown complete assembly
pair opens only the Mods configuration and diagnostic controls while gameplay patches and services
remain stopped.

`BepInEx/LogOutput.log` contains a warning beginning:

```text
Gameplay runtime quarantined: the installed game build does not match an audited baseline.
```

Run **Mods > Runtime > Check game math** and include its result in your report. Waiting for an
audited ModSuite release is the safe choice. If you choose to proceed at your own risk, the
[configuration guide](configuration.md#game-updates-and-compatibility-quarantine) explains the two
exact-build acknowledgement controls.

A refusal beginning `Refusing to load even the diagnostic control plane` means the suite could not
identify the complete assembly pair. Do not try to acknowledge that state. Report the game version
and attach `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` on the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/OrbAutomata/OrbOfCreation-ModSuite/issues).

## The suite does not load

1. Confirm that BepInEx files are beside `Orb Of Creation.exe`. On Proton, recheck the `winhttp`
   override in the [installation guide](installation.md#2-install-bepinex-5).
2. Confirm that exactly one `OrbModSuite.dll` exists anywhere under `BepInEx/plugins`.
3. Remove separate `OrbAutomata.dll`, `OrbMentor.dll`, `OrbModConfig.dll`, and
   `OrbModding.Common.dll` files; they are not part of the one-plugin installation.
4. Search `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` for missing dependencies, duplicate plugin identities, assembly
   errors, or the compatibility refusal described above.

If `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` does not exist, BepInEx itself did not start. Repeat the BepInEx section
of the installation guide before troubleshooting the ModSuite.

## The Mods tab shows only the configuration plugin

Confirm that the BepInEx log lists **Orb Of Creation ModSuite** during startup. Remove duplicate
suite DLLs and test-stub DLLs from the game directory, then restart the game.

## My settings are missing

The suite reads only `BepInEx/config/dev.vojow.orbofcreation.modsuite.cfg`. Settings in separate
per-plugin files are not imported. Reapply the wanted values in the Mods tab and keep the other
files only as personal references.

If the current suite configuration has an unsupported or malformed schema marker, the suite stops
before changing gameplay. Restore an adjacent `.pre-schema-v*.bak` file if one exists, or move the
current file aside so the suite can create defaults; do not lower the schema marker by hand.

## Steam Deck UI problems or severe frame-rate loss

Press **STOP ALL** first. If the problem clears, resume and enable features one at a time to identify
the trigger. Create a bug report after reproducing the problem, then include whether the native
autoqueue and NG+ tabs were unlocked and which features were active.

## Auto Concept repeatedly changes the same concept

Press **STOP ALL**, then create a bug report immediately. Include the affected concept and resource
names with your reproduction steps. The report preserves the suite's recent decisions and the live
refusal reason without requiring you to copy individual log lines.

## Checking the suite against the live game

**Mods > Runtime > Check game math** compares the suite's economy and purchase decisions with the
loaded game without changing the game. Load a save first. The check runs in one frame, so the game
will visibly pause while it completes; its result is written to `BepInEx/LogOutput.log`.

An `INCOMPLETE` result names a condition the suite does not model and therefore refuses to automate.
Include that result in a problem report.

## Reporting a problem

1. Reproduce the problem, if it is safe to do so.
2. Open **Mods > Runtime** and press **Create bug report** immediately.
3. Inspect the resulting `orb-modsuite-diagnostics-<timestamp>.zip`. If you intend to share its
   included save data publicly, attach the bundle and concise reproduction steps to an
   [issue](https://github.com/OrbAutomata/OrbOfCreation-ModSuite/issues). Otherwise, open the issue
   with the reproduction steps and say that a bundle is available for private transfer.

The zip is created under `BepInEx/config/OrbOfCreation-ModSuite/diagnostics/` and is capped at
10 MiB. It can contain recent activity, settings, a BepInEx log tail, and identifiable top-level
save files. Text is redacted for known usernames and absolute paths, but save files remain exact
private game data. Inspect the archive and share it only with a recipient you trust.

If the action fails, the Runtime page explains why and no partial report is presented as ready.
Attach `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` instead when it is available.

After recovery, return to [configuration](configuration.md). If you want to remove the suite,
follow [uninstalling](uninstalling.md).
