/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The portable gate proves the collector's logic against stand-ins, and the contract manifest proves
/// every member it names exists in the shipped assembly's metadata with the expected shape. Neither
/// proves the part in between: that a compiled accessor binds and reads on a live object without
/// throwing, that a registry actually holds entities, that an identity is neither empty nor claimed
/// twice, that an edge points at something the snapshot contains — or what any of it costs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It also answers the question the whole derived-value strategy rests on and that no amount of static
/// analysis can: <b>does the number the collector publishes equal the number the game itself would
/// read</b>. That is <c>GetValue()</c> — <c>calculationDirty ? Calculate() : calculatedValue</c> — and
/// not <c>Calculate()</c>. The distinction is not academic: a record with no modifiers is never
/// dirtied, so the game's <c>GetValue()</c> returns its <c>[NonSerialized]</c> zero for the whole
/// session while a recomputation returns the base value. A rung that compared against
/// <c>Adjust(baseValue)</c> alone answered "is our arithmetic right" — yes, 5595 of 5595 — while every
/// structure price was wrong, because the question that decides a purchase is "is our arithmetic the
/// number the game will charge from".
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// That survey walks entity registries, and a price is not made only of entity records. Two of its
/// terms belong to nobody it enumerates: the frame-wide <c>Player</c> globals, whose record lives
/// inside a <c>DoubleVariable</c> no registry holds, and the per-quantity modifier, which is a
/// <c>ValueModifierVariable</c> a structure points at rather than owns. Both multiply into every
/// structure price and neither was compared against anything, so "fold PASSED" was a statement about
/// a strict subset of what a price consumes. <see cref="CheckFrameGlobalFolds"/> and
/// <see cref="CheckCostPerQuantity"/> close that, and the fold verdict now means what it reads as.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Nothing here takes a write path collection does not already take.</b> Almost every game
/// accessor called below is a field return or a <c>Count</c> comparison, verified against the
/// decompiled originals, and the one derived comparison (<c>GetTrueQuantity()</c>) reaches through
/// <c>quality.AsPercent()</c>, which would recalculate a dirty record, so it is made only when that
/// record is already clean. Two calls are not inert: <c>GetPurchaseCost()</c> recalculates the
/// records its chain touches, and <c>IsAvailable()</c> walks the prerequisite gate and latches.
/// <c>IsAvailable()</c> is a call collection itself makes on every structure and upgrade of every
/// cycle, so asking it again widens nothing; <c>GetPurchaseCost()</c> is the oracle this check
/// exists to consult, and settling a memo the game would have settled on its next render is the
