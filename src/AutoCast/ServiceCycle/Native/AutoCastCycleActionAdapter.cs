/// <summary>
/// The native execution boundary for Auto Cast. The pure worker plans at most one cast or one charge
/// release; this adapter revalidates that decision against the live game on the main thread and
/// submits it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Four guards run before the native port is asked for anything. The configuration is re-checked, so a
/// feature switched off between planning and execution rejects without a penalty. The action-family
/// lease is re-read, because another plugin can take it mid-cycle and a spell cast without it is this
/// suite acting on content it has stood down from. The native world epoch is compared with the epoch
/// the plan carries by value, refusing a plan made against another run of the game. Then the manual
/// pause is refreshed and consulted, which is what stops a cast planned a moment before the player
/// cast something by hand from landing a moment after it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// After that the port owns the verdict, and most of its refusals are ordinary. Auto Cast's planner
/// sees strictly less than this boundary does — whether a target request is open, whether the caster
/// is free, and whether the spell has anything to aim at are all live-only (W60) — so those three
/// reject penalty-free and say so. What is not ordinary is an attempted mutation the verifier could
/// not confirm: the fire hook's epoch not advancing by exactly one means a cast that spent something
/// other than what was planned, and that faults.
