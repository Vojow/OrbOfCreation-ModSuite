/// <summary>
/// The pure Spell Leveling worker policy: given the pinned world and the pinned configuration it
/// plans at most one mastery-level purchase and waits for the next publication. It owns no state
/// between cycles — no capability latch, no retry counter, no backoff — because a fresh world every
/// generation is the only input it has ever needed.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The plan is deliberately thinner than the boundary's verdict. Discovery and mastery readiness are
/// published facts and are tested here; the leveling prerequisite and the level's affordability are
/// not published (W59) and are re-read live by the action adapter. That split is the M3 ruling made
/// concrete: the boundary is the authority on feasibility, so a planner that proposes a level the game
/// refuses costs one penalty-free rejection, while a planner that cannot see readiness would propose
/// one on every cycle forever.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Ranking is lowest mastery level first, so the spell furthest behind catches up rather than the
/// strongest running away. Ties break on identity order, which is the order every published table is
/// already sorted in. The rule is total and reproducible, and a tie only decides which of two equally
/// ranked spells goes this cycle — the other goes next.
