/// <see cref="AutoSpellLevelCapability.Locked"/>, because that answer is the leveling prerequisite and
/// prerequisites are a boundary fact (W59). So the capability is main-thread state, seeded by a probe

/// It resets to <see cref="AutoSpellLevelCapability.Locked"/> on a lifecycle boundary rather than
/// keeping the last generation's answer. Nothing is retained across a boundary, and a tooltip that
/// claims the previous save's progression is worse than one that admits it does not know yet.
