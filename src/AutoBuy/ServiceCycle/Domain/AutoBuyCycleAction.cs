/// <para>
/// A native refusal of a planned purchase is either expected snapshot staleness or a structural

/// Only the binding resource is carried, not every cost row: it is the one that set
/// <see cref="CostRatio"/> for the exact group this action requests. A preferred one-level action
/// retains its original admission belief byte for byte; a multi-level or reduced action carries the
/// exact group comparison against the remaining batch ledger. The two counts beside it say how many
/// rows there were and how many of them were priced at all. Nought priced rows out of several is the
/// shape of the game's uncooked boot prices, where every structure reads as free.
