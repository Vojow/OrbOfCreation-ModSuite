/// No control state. The worker is a per-cycle planner: it projects the pinned world and produces a
/// batch of purchase decisions purely as a function of that projection plus the pinned
/// configuration. There is no ranked-pass cursor, no group/batch counter, no retry/backoff
/// dictionary — pacing and fairness come from one-batch-per-cycle emission and fresh world
/// publications, so the worker never re-plans stale state.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The scratch carries nothing between cycles: every evaluation overwrites it before reading it. It
/// lives here because the row arrays underneath it are worth reusing and the state is the one thing
/// the worker owns for a whole lifecycle.
