/// a decision now reaches the worker as a result code it records in its own state. See W45.

/// The structural safety audit is taken here too, from the same snapshot. It used to run against the
/// live objects while the binding resolved, which made it a native read on the main thread and a
/// verdict cached for a lifecycle; it is now a pure reading of collected facts, taken every cycle
/// beside the facts it will be judged with.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Binding resolution used to happen here as well, to reach two uuids
/// <see cref="AutoHarvestKnownIds"/> already holds. It stayed at the action boundary, which resolves
/// the pair it is about to mutate and re-checks its lifecycle there; a copy taken while deciding was
/// a pre-filter over an answer that had to be taken again anyway.

/// left to attribute — the runtime times the whole evaluation. See W51.
