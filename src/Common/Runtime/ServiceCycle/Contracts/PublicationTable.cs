/// The one audited bounded container permitted inside an immutable service-cycle publication

/// or collections because a shared mutable backing store would let one consumer alter a value
/// another consumer has already pinned. This type closes that hole structurally rather than by
/// convention: the backing array is private, is copied from the caller's span at construction so no
/// external alias survives, and is never handed back as an array, collection, or mutable view.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The shape is deliberately the same one <c>AutoBuyCycleFrame</c> already relies on — a private
/// array behind read-only accessors — promoted from a per-feature convention into a Common-owned
/// primitive the structural validator can recognize by name. Elements are values, so an element read
/// cannot alias the table, and <typeparamref name="T"/> is still walked under the full rules of the
/// role the table appears in: admitting the container does not admit its contents.
/// <para>
/// The residual gap is that the declaring type could mutate its own private array after publication.
/// C# 10 cannot express deep immutability (see <c>docs/runtime-architecture/architecture.md</c>), so
/// copy-on-construction plus the absence of any mutating member is what makes this safe in practice.
