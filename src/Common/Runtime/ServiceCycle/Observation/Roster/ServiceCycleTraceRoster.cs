/// The semantic stream identifies a service by a number, because a number is what fits in a fixed
/// record and strings never enter a payload. A number is also unreadable: a reader looking at
/// service 2 has no way to learn it was Auto Harvest. The roster closes that without touching the
/// record, by saying once per session what the numbers meant.

/// <para>
/// Every entry carries the machine identity as well as the display name. The machine identity is the
/// durable one — it is what the runtime actually registered — so a reader that does not recognise a
/// display name, or finds it empty, still has something exact to show instead of a bare ordinal.
/// </para>

/// Entries are kinded rather than assumed to be services. Only services are recorded today, but the
/// same question is coming for the configuration and strategy publications, and a roster that already
/// says what kind of thing each row names answers it without a second artifact.
