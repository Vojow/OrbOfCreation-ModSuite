/// scheduling — ordering between services stays conceptual.

/// The generation is the whole point of publishing rather than sharing a mutable object. There is no
/// value in a service acting twice on the same reading of the world, so a consumer records the
/// generation it last acted on and waits until the published one differs. <see cref="WorldGeneration"/>
/// rejects zero precisely so that a consumer's initial <c>default</c> can never collide with a real
/// publication.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The first publication is generation 1 and normally carries an empty world, since collection has
/// not run yet. That is deliberate: a service that starts early reads "nothing known" through the
/// ordinary lookup path and proceeds, rather than blocking on a snapshot that may be a frame away.
/// It also means generation 1 is spoken for: a caller stamping generations with a frame counter must
/// not stamp frame 1, which no real host does — Unity's counter is already in the thousands by the
/// time a save is playable.
