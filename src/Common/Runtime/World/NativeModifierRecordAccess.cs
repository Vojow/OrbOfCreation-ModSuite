/// nothing and had Auto Buy plan a purchase for every one of them. Folding unconditionally was the
/// second, and it is subtler: a record with <em>no modifiers</em> is a record nothing ever dirtied, so
/// the game never recomputes it and <c>GetValue()</c> returns its zero for the rest of the session —
/// while the fold returned the base value. <c>StructureSO.passiveCostMod</c> is such a record, 100
/// against 0, and the two land on opposite sides of the <c>Max</c> in <c>GetNextCostMod()</c>. Every
