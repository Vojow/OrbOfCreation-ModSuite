/// This is the off-thread half of world collection. It exists as its own type, rather than as logic
/// inside a capture adapter, so that all derivation is reachable from tests without the game and so

/// motivated the split.
/// <para>
/// Derivation is confined to arithmetic over captured values, and where it reproduces one of the
/// game's own compositions it says which one and matches it exactly. That is sanctioned rather than
/// silent: <c>docs/runtime-architecture/goals-and-invariants.md</c> permits owned economy math that is
/// transcribed from a hash-gated build and differentially verified, and forbids inventing formulas the
/// game has not been read for. Native revalidation at the action boundary stays authoritative
/// regardless.

/// Unreadable arithmetic fails neutral, not confident: a NaN operand yields uncapped, zero-headroom,
