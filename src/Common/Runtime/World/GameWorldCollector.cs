/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// This is the shared pass that replaces per-service collection. Roughly ten services are expected to
/// want resource state every tick; each capturing its own copy costs the main thread once per service
/// for readings that are identical by construction. One pass, published like configuration, makes that
/// cost constant in the number of services instead of linear.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Read what the game reads, and never write.</b> Every accessor a binder installs reads state the
/// game stores. Nothing in this type classifies or scales anything either; that all happens in
/// <see cref="Build"/>, off the Unity thread.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The read-only requirement is stricter than it sounds, because several of the game's accessors
/// write on read. <c>ValueModifierRecord.GetValue()</c> recalculates and re-stamps its observable
/// when its dirty flag is set, so it is reproduced rather than called — and reproducing it means
/// reproducing the branch, not just the arithmetic. A clean record reads as its
/// <c>calculatedValue</c>, because that memo is the number the game will act on; a dirty one reads as
/// its fold over <c>baseValue</c> and the two modifier sets, because that is what the game would
/// recompute. Each half alone shipped a live failure in the opposite direction. See
/// <see cref="NativeModifierRecordAccess"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Two readings still call the game, and both should stop.</b> <c>GetTrueRate()</c> composes
/// several rate terms and <c>IsAvailable()</c> walks a prerequisite graph, and each reaches
/// <c>GetValue()</c> underneath — so these are precisely the calls that can still make the game
/// recompute on the suite's schedule. They are next in line for the same
/// port-then-differentially-verify treatment the purchase-cost chain has had. Porting them one at a
/// time is deliberate: two unverified transcriptions at once leave a differential failure
/// unattributable to either.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Accessors bind once.</b> Each category compiles its readers at construction, so the warm path
/// is a direct call returning an unboxed value. This is the technique that removed roughly 15 ms from
/// Auto Buy's 23.7 ms collect; see <see cref="NativeAccessorBinder"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Failure is per category, then per entity.</b> A build that renamed one research member still
/// yields resources, structures, and upgrades, and a single unreadable entity costs one row rather
/// than the pass. Every shortfall is reported through <see cref="WorldCollectionReport"/>, because a
/// partial snapshot that reports itself as complete would have consumers read "no research" as a fact
/// about the save rather than a fact about the read.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Adding a category is a binder, a row type, and one line here.</b> Traversal, identity claiming,
/// failure capture, buffer growth, sorting, and table construction are all generic; see
/// <see cref="WorldRowBinder{TSample, TRow}"/>. That is deliberate — the game persists per-entity
/// state for roughly thirty categories, and a design that costs a hand-written traversal apiece would
