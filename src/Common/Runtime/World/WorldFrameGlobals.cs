/// to take the record's cache raw, and that is the defect this file was at the centre of:
/// <c>Player</c>'s globals sit outside the per-tick refresh the economy gives <c>ResourceSO</c>, so on
/// the first cold collection after a load <c>GetStructureCost()</c>'s cache was still the zero it
/// deserialises to. Nothing guarded it, <c>AsPercent(0)</c> is zero, and a zero cost multiplier
/// priced all 180 structures at nothing. What that read was missing was the dirty flag beside it: a
/// record deserialised at zero and marked dirty is one the game will recompute, and the reading now
/// recomputes it too. A record the game will <em>not</em> recompute still reads as its memo, because
/// that is the number the game will charge.
